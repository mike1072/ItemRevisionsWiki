| *CLCK10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK10.png "Robe of Fire Resistance") | **Robe of Fire Resistance**<br /><br />Due to the extremely volatile nature of most magics, Robes of Fire Resistance are not uncommon among young acolytes and their wizardly tutors, especially in Thay's circles and enclaves where worship of the Firelord Kossuth is widespread.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +40% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *CLCK11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK11.png "Robe of Electric Resistance") | **Robe of Electric Resistance**<br /><br />While seen with less frequency than some other Mage Robes, those of Electrical Resistance can hardly be considered a rarity.

| *CLCK14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK14.png "Adventurer's Robe") | **Adventurer's Robe**<br /><br />Former Royal Magician Vangerdahast to King Azoun IV of Cormyr was once an accomplished adventurer of high fame. One reason he became popular in wizardly circles was his creation of the Adventurer's Robe. Mages have always struggled with the limitations placed on them by the ability to cast arcane magics.

The resulting robes grant the wearer significant resistance to all spells, and are a favored defensive tool of powerful spellcasters, but beyond just mere magical protection, a robe such as this is a symbol of prestige.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +20% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 6<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *CLCK16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK16.png "Robe of the Battlemage") | **Robe of the Battlemage**<br /><br />Battlemages are wizards trained to fight in the heat of combat, and developing their abilities for the purpose of offensive use. Battlemages are dangerous to behold, deadly and capable of long-term combat survival. In order to make themselves all the more lethal in a battle field, battlemages wear robes which offer protection from all forms of physical attack, while at the same time increasing their fighting skills and resistance.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> THAC0: +2 bonus<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +10 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 6<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|

The school presented no bias in its teachings, and hosted casters from all across the Sword Coast until its destruction some 200 years ago.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Caster Level: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /> Magic Damage Resistance: +20% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 6<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *CLCK18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK18.png "Robe of Acid Resistance") | **Robe of Acid Resistance**<br /><br />Though seen with less frequency than most other Mage Robes, those of Acid Resistance can still be quite useful. Protective garments such as this one are usually made by a wizard to protect a clumsy assistant or by an alchemist working on the strangest of potions. As with others of its type, however, its use is restricted to students of the arcane.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Acid Resistance: +40%<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|

| *NPARM*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPARM.png "Jansen AdventureWear") | **Jansen AdventureWear**<br /><br />Jansen-Brand Metal-Repellant AdventureWear - (patent pending)<br /><br />This strange armor is made of a foreign material, very supple but strong to the touch. Designed by and for Jan Jansen, only he may wear it.

| *WA2ROBE*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WA2ROBE.png "Robe of Larloch") | **Robe of Larloch**<br /><br />This cast-off robe of the archlich Larloch absorbed significant amounts of the Netherese arcanist's power in its few decades on his body. Though incredibly potent for most mortal practitioners of the Art, the robe was not valuable enough for Larloch to keep.<br />Larloch "lives" in the ancient Warlock's Crypt on the Sword Coast in a necropolis populated by hordes of undead and a small army of Larloch's lich students. Presumably, he has forgotten entirely about this dusty robe, but one can never be too certain, nor too safe, when it comes to wearing Netherese artifacts...<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /> Casting speed: +2 bonus<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 4<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|
