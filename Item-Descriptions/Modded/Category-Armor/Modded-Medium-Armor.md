| *CHAN03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN03.png "Mail of the Dead +2") | **Mail of the Dead +2**<br /><br />A mage can make an extremely effective assassin, as Vorusta illustrated over 400 years ago. He would create skeleton warriors equipped with this enchanted armor and a powerful blade, and give their circlet of power to the target as a friendly gift. When the killing machine was through with its work, Vorusta retrieved the equipment and started the entire process over. In spite of the centuries passed without been worn by an undead minion it still emanates a dark taint and has mantained some of the previous owner's powers.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Protects Against Critical Hits<br /> Saving Throws: +3 bonus vs. death<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 40<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Archer<br /> Beast Master<br /> Stalker<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *CHAN06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN06.png "Mithral Chain Mail +4") | **Mithral Chain Mail +4**<br /><br />This is the personal armor of Drizzt, the famous dark elf ranger. It was forged for him by his friend Bruenor. Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. This chain mail does not encumber more than a leather armor and is treated as a light armor for purposes of movement and other limitations. In addition, this suit of chain mail is highly enchanted and gives additional bonuses to the wearer's armor class.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Archer<br /> Beast Master<br /> Stalker<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *CHAN07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN07.png "Chain Mail +3") | **Chain Mail +3**<br /><br />This perfectly crafted chain mail is the standard armor of deep dwarf elite fighters.

| *CHAN09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN09.png "Darkmail +3") | **Darkmail +3**<br /><br />Whether by design or through exposure to extensive military campaigns and battles, the chain links of this armor are coal black throughout. While legends usually speak of knights in shining armor facing vile beasts, the enchantments on this suit suggest equally great, if unheralded, battles with evil creatures of darkness.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to fear and disease effects<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 40<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Archer<br /> Beast Master<br /> Stalker<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *CHAN10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN10.png "Prismatic Chain +4") | **Prismatic Chain +4**<br /><br />Rainbow Armor<br />Armor of this type is not for those who wish to remain anonymous. More often it is associated with tales of the vain, and bards have even crafted songs about the appearance of 'rainbow warriors' on a battlefield. The protective quality of the multihued surface is undeniable, but it is unfortunate that the mage who crafted these items was colorblind.<br /><br />This multicolored armor is infused with the wizard's spell Prismatic Spray. Every so often, simply by will alone, the bearer can release the magic of the suit, which then begins to slowly absorb energy from the Weave to regain its magical power.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Prismatic Explosion: multicolored rays of light flash from the armor, all opponents within 20 feet are affected by one or more rays which have the following effects<br /><br />Red: 20 fire damage (save vs. breath half)<br />Orange: 40 acid damage (breath half)<br />Yellow: 80 electrical damage (breath half)<br />Green: Death (save vs. poison neg.)<br />Blue: Polymorph (save vs. polymorph neg.)<br />Indigo: Feeblemind (save vs. wands neg.)<br />Violet: Maze (save vs. spell neg.)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +15% bonus<br /> Acid Resistance: +15% bonus<br /> Electrical Resistance: +15% bonus<br /> Protection from Spells: Color Spray, Chromatic Orb & Prismatic Spray<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 40<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Archer<br /> Beast Master<br /> Stalker<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *CHAN11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN11.png "Crimson Chain +5") | **Crimson Chain +5**<br /><br />The dark red metal used to make this chain is said to come from a hidden mine in the Cloudpeaks. At one time the Bloodway, a band of berserkers adventurers, all wore armor of this kind, but the other suits have long been lost.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Blood Rage: 5% chance when struck the wearer enrages, gaining +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls for 5 rounds<br /> Tireless Rage: wearer doesn't become winded at the end of any rage state<br /><br />Armor Class: 0<br />Weight: 40<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master<br /> Stalker<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *CHAN21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN21.png "Chain Mail +3") | **Chain Mail +3**<br /><br />Typical golden chainmail worn by Balthazar's Mercenaries.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 40<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Archer<br /> Beast Master<br /> Stalker|
| *DWCHAN02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWCHAN02.png "Drowcraft Adamantine Chain +3") | **Drowcraft Adamantine Chain +3**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft armor is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wearer exceptional protection. Drowcraft armor will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />This chain mail is dull black, almost purple, and does not reflect light unless carefully polished to do so. It has been crafted with a drow-made alloy of adamantine, steel, and other secret materials, crafted in the faerzress of the Underdark, making it highly resistant to physical blows.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: increased armor class<br /> Physical Resistance: +5% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 0<br />Weight: 40<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Beast Master|
| *NPCHAN*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPCHAN.png "Corthala Family Armor +3") | **Corthala Family Armor +3**<br /><br />This armor, long in the Corthala bloodline, is a heavily enchanted mithral chain mail. The armor has been crafted by powerful mages of the Corthala family in order to effectively fight other mages. The armor makes the wearer immune to charm and detection by magical means ensuring he can plan his actions and pursue his targets without worring about external interference. As it is specially fitted for Valygar, few other than he may wear it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Non-Detection<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 20<br />Usable By:<br /> Valygar|

# Modded Elven Chain Mail
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *CHAN12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN12.png "Elven Chain") | **Elven Chain**<br /><br />The delicate yet sturdy craftsmanship of the Elven races allows them to design many beautiful yet utilitarian goods. Among these is Elven chain mail, which is so finely wrought that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence. This and its lightness allows it to be worn by thieves and fighter/mages with few restrictions.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Elf<br /> Half elf<br /> Human|
| *CHAN13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN13.png "Elven Chain +1") | **Elven Chain +1**<br /><br />This mail feels more akin to cloth than to metal, and may be worn by thieves with few penalties and by fighter-mages without removing their spellcasting ability. This variety of mail is woven in almost exactly the same form by both elves and the Drow; its design has changed little since the Drow's elven past and is used for surface forays, where Adamantine Drow chain would decay.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Elf<br /> Half elf<br /> Human|
| *CHAN14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN14.png "Sylvan Chain +3") | **Sylvan Chain +3**<br /><br />This light but strong mail is of Sylvan elf construction, and its elegance is only exceeded by its rarity. Normally granted only to especially brave elves, seldom is this armor found outside of a wood elf tribe, and rarer still on someone not of elven lineage.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Nature's Blessing: +2 bonus to AC and saving throws vs. unnatural creatures<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Elf<br /> Half elf<br /> Human|
| *CHAN15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN15.png "Melodic Chain +2") | **Melodic Chain +2**<br /><br />The Bards of Melody were a small band of half-elf bardic warriors who entertained and defended scattered elven communities throughout Calimshan. Enchantments allowed only minstrels to wear their armor, the magical links sliding together to produce beautiful melodies as they danced or fought. Unfortunately the Bards of Melody were disbanded hundreds of years ago, and the secret of 'playing' the armor faded with them.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to silence<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard|
| *CHAN16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN16.png "Bladesinger Chain +4") | **Bladesinger Chain +4**<br /><br />The lore of this suit is difficult to determine, either due to the exotic circumstances from which it sprang, or the wish of its previous owner to conceal its location. Secrecy would certainly be desirable, as even rumors of such mail as this could provoke deadly interest. It is the pinnacle of elven craft, and a truly blessed item.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Casting Speed: +1 bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Elf<br /> Half elf<br /> Human|
| *CHAN19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN19.png "Aslyferund Elven Chain +5") | **Aslyferund Elven Chain +5**<br /><br />While in exile from Myth Drannor, Aslyferund learned the secret of fashioning powerful Elven armor by gilding and heavily enchanting normal Elven Chain, it is rumored with the aid of a gold dragon. Alas, his refusal to divulge the secret lead to his murder by a rival smith.<br /><br />How Cespenar came into possession of the secret is a mystery.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Casting Speed: +1 bonus<br /> Immunity to normal weapons<br /><br />Armor Class: 0<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Elf<br /> Half elf<br /> Human|
| *DWCHAN01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWCHAN01.png "Drowcraft Spellchain +1") | **Drowcraft Spellchain +1**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft armor is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wearer exceptional protection. Drowcraft armor will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />This magical drow chain mail, much like their cousins' elven chain is so finely wrought that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence, and allows it to be worn with few restrictions. This powerful drow armor also increases the wearer's magic resistance, and casting speed factor.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: increased armor class<br /> Casting Speed: +1 bonus<br /> Magic Resistance: +5% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *CLOLTH*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLOLTH.png "Dark Elven Spellchain +3") | **Dark Elven Spellchain +3**<br /><br />This mail feels more akin to cloth than to metal, and may be worn by thieves with few penalties and by fighter-mages without impairing their spellcasting ability. This variety of mail is woven in almost exactly the same form by both elves and drows; its design has changed little since the drow's elven past and is used for surface forays, where drowcrafted chain would decay.<br /><br />The light-coloured elven variety of this armor has no restrictions aside from wearer's size, but the dark drow variety is magically attuned to its owner, and thus can be worn only by drows.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to blindness<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Drow|

# Modded Splint Mail
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *CHAN04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN04.png "Splint Mail") | **Splint Mail**<br /><br />Splint Mail is a variant of banded mail in which the metal strips are applied vertically to the backing of chain, leather, or cloth rather than horizontally as in banded mail. Since the human body does not swivel in mid-torso as much as it flexes back to front, splint mail is more restrictive in battle.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 45<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Beast Master<br /> Shapeshifter<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *CHAN05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN05.png "Splint Mail +1") | **Splint Mail +1**<br /><br />Splint Mail is a variant of banded mail in which the metal strips are applied vertically to the backing of chain, leather, or cloth rather than horizontally as in banded mail. Since the human body does not swivel in mid-torso as much as it flexes back to front, splint mail is more restrictive in battle. This suit of armor is enchanted, granting the wearer a bonus of +1 to their armor class.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 45<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Beast Master<br /> Shapeshifter<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *CHAN17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN17.png "Ashen Scales +2") | **Ashen Scales +2**<br /><br />Instead of metal strips, this armor uses wyvern scales bound to a chain backing by means of a magical fire. The resulting armor is ash grey in color and more flexible than standard splint mail. A ranger, Usher Skacan, made this armor after slaying several wyverns that were killing all the deer and elk in his forest.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to poison effects<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 35<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Shapeshifter<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *CHAN18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN18.png "Armor of Faith +3") | **Armor of Faith +3**<br /><br />This armor is a combination of chainmail with metal plates (breastplate, epaulettes, elbow guards, gauntlets, tasses, and greaves) covering vital areas. Buckles and straps hold the whole suit together and distribute the weight, but the armor still hangs more loosely than full plate. Created in a forge blessed by gods to match the resolve shown by the wearer this armor almost glows with its own light. Worn by divine champions and paladins it is a symbol of the righteous and the bold.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Casting Speed: +1 bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 45<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *CHAN20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CHAN20.png "White Dragonscale Armor +5") | **White Dragonscale Armor +5**<br /><br />White Dragon Armor is lightweight, strong, and highly resistant to cold. These suits are much sought after, but few smiths are willing to craft them. The necessary materials are rare and dangerous to acquire, and dragons have long memories where their kin are concerned. Most smiths would prefer not to even risk association with the trade in dragon hide. This splint mail of natural-source can be worn by more classes than other similarly protective armors.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (3 times/day):<br /> Cone of Freezing Cold: inflicts 10d4 + 10 points of cold damage and slows targets for 5 rounds, a successful save vs. breath at -4 halves the damage and negates slowness<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Cold Resistance: +50% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: -1<br />Weight: 35<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Shapeshifter<br /> Avenger<br /> Kensai<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker|
