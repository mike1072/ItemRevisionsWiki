| *PLAT01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT01.png "Plate Mail") | **Plate Mail**<br /><br />Plate mail is a combination of chain armor with metal plates covering the vital areas such as the chest, abdomen and groin. Similar in construction to bronze plate mail, true plate mail comprises of chain and leather.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT02.png "Plate Mail +1") | **Plate Mail +1**<br /><br />Plate mail is a combination of chain armor with metal plates covering the vital areas such as the chest, abdomen and groin. Similar in construction to bronze plate mail, true plate mail comprises of chain and leather. In addition, this suit of plate mail is enchanted and gives additional bonuses to the wearer's armor class.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT06.png "Ankheg Plate Mail +1") | **Ankheg Plate Mail +1**<br /><br />This magical plate mail has been expertly crafted. Sheathed in the chitinous scales of the ankheg, it provides a greater degree of protection than traditional plate mail and is not susceptible to rust. As any world-weary adventurer will tell you, however, the best appreciated aspect of ankheg mail is its light weight and low encumbrance. Monsters come and go but fatigue is a constant enemy.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Acid Resistance: +40% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 35<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *PLAT08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT08.png "Radiant Plate +2") | **Radiant Plate +2**<br /><br />This brilliant golden armor has a short history. A priestess of Lathander named Iraeni of Suzail had it constructed for the champion of her church, a warrior-priest named Beldan Miller. Beldan employed the armor frequently, as Iraeni was often attacked by agents of Myrkul. After twenty years of serving Lathander, Iraeni decided to step down from her office, as did Beldan. They were married shortly after. Beldan gave the armor to an errant paladin of Lathander, who is believed to have died fighting a powerful undead creature in Amn.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Protection from Evil: +2 bonus to AC and saving throws vs. evil creatures<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT10.png "Plate Mail +2") | **Plate Mail +2**<br /><br />Plate mail is a combination of chain armor with metal plates covering the vital areas such as the chest, abdomen and groin. Similar in construction to bronze plate mail, true plate mail comprises of chain and leather. This suit of plate mail is highly enchanted and gives additional bonuses to the wearer's armor class.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT11.png "Delver's Plate +2") | **Delver's Plate +2**<br /><br />This armor has been worn by many a fine soldier, but among the best known, and for whom it was named, was Delver Kinlake. He was a vagabond whose strong sword-arm and keen wits made him a respected general to the Lords of Waterdeep. A gift from Lord Baeron, the armor served Delver well for thirty years, and after his death, it passed to his eldest son. It has since made its way into the hands of a variety of adventurers, being much-desired for its strength and the magical defense it provides.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Damage Resistance: +50% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT12.png "Doomplate +3") | **Doomplate +3**<br /><br />Named by Adarius Shin, the Doomplate is deserving of its foreboding title. He had hoped to strike fear in his enemies, but Adarius set a grim precedent when he mysteriously died soon after donning the suit, just as every adventurer who has worn it since has done. It might be said, however, that most adventurers die in their armor and are not known for their longevity.<br /><br />Note: Aura of Despair effect is not cumulative with a Doom spell or similar magic.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Aura of Despair: opponents within 10 feet suffer -2 penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws<br /> Luck: -1 penalty (-5% for skills)<br /><br />Armor Class: 0<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT13.png "Deep Guardian's Plate +4") | **Deep Guardian's Plate +4**<br /><br />In an effort to better protect their soldiers, the artificers of ancient Imaskar set about creating a kind of living symbiote, something that would bond with their user and protect them from harm. Using specimens pulled from the deepest pits of the ocean, the Imaskari spellcasters slowly began to graft these magically-enhanced creatures onto suits of plate mail, weaning them off of salt water and forcing them to rely on magic for nourishment. This technique worked well, allowing the user a far greater resistance to spells than normal... but other magewrights looked upon this creation with a growing fear, worried that a creature that fed on magic might soon grow too hungry and feed upon its masters instead. Because of this, only a few suits of this armor were ever made, and the creatures created by the Imaskari sealed away and forgotten.<br /><br />The living symbiote feeds itself with low level spells and consumes them in the process, thus making the wearer completely immune to 1st and 2nd level spells. Unfortunately it doesn't distinguish between harmful and friendly magic, but at least it doesn't seem to interfere with spells cast by the wearer.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Spell Level Immunity: 1st and 2nd level spells are unable to affect the wearer<br /><br />Armor Class: -1<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT18.png "Red Dragonplate Armor +5") | **Red Dragonplate Armor +5**<br /><br />Red Dragon Scale armor is light of weight, strong, and resistant to fire. Because of these properties it is much sought after, but finding, let alone slaying, a powerful ancient dragon is nearly impossible. It is usually easier to search for an existing suit, such as this one. One should be careful wearing it near dragons, however, particularly red ones.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +50% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: -2<br />Weight: 40<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT22.png "Shuruppak's Plate +5") | **Shuruppak's Plate +5**<br /><br />Shuruppak, the infamous right hand of the now dead god Gilgeam, earned the title of "Reaper" for his savage butchery of any who opposed him... an identity the bloodthirsty madman eagerly embraced. Before Gilgeam's destruction, the god presented Shuruppak with an enchanted suit of armor, to better enable the Reaper to slaughter his foes.<br /><br />Shuruppak's mithral plate mail is surprisingly light and allows the wearer an unnatural quickness and grace for a heavy armor. It is not known how Shuruppak lost this treasured item, but one could safely assume he is still looking for it...<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Free Action: the wearer is immune to everything, magical and otherwise, that limits his mobility in any way<br /><br />Armor Class: -2<br />Weight: 30<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|

# Modded Full Plate Armor

| *DWPLAT01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWPLAT01.png "Drowcraft Adamantine Full Plate +3") | **Drowcraft Adamantine Full Plate +3**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft armor is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wearer exceptional protection. Drowcraft armor will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />This full plate is dull black, almost purple, and does not reflect light unless carefully polished to do so. It has been crafted with a drow-made alloy of adamantine, steel, and other secret materials, crafted in the faerzress of the Underdark, making it highly resistant to physical blows.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: increased armor class<br /> Physical Resistance: +5% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: -4<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *NPPLAT*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPPLAT.png "Firecam Full Plate Mail +2") | **Firecam Full Plate Mail +2**<br /><br />This armor belonged to the Firecam House for generations but it never had seen such glory before passing to Keldorn's possession. Keldorn had proven himself to be one of the mightiest and more devoted champion of Torm, and the god himself blessed the suit bestowing his protection in the form of a magical shield. The armor can absorb a high amount of magical damage and any who dares to strike Torm's favourite suffers proper retribution as the god's shield damages the unfaithful ones with its magical energy. This suit is designed for Keldorn and only he can wear it without incurring in Torm's wrath.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Damage Resistance: +40% bonus<br /> Retribution: all who strike the wearer in melee suffer 5 points of magic damage<br /><br />Armor Class: -1<br />Weight: 60<br />Usable By:<br /> Keldorn|
| *PLAT04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT04.png "Full Plate Mail") | **Full Plate Mail**<br /><br />Full plate armor is the best armor a warrior can buy, both in appearance and protection. The perfectly fitted interlocking plates are specially angled to deflect arrows and blows, and the entire suit is carefully adorned with rich engraving and embossed detail.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT05.png "Full Plate Mail +1") | **Full Plate Mail +1**<br /><br />Full plate armor is the best armor a warrior can buy, both in appearance and protection. The perfectly fitted interlocking plates are specially angled to deflect arrows and blows, and the entire suit is carefully adorned with rich engraving and embossed detail. With its magical enchantments, this suit of full plate is ideal for warriors.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 0<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT09.png "Mithral Full Plate +2") | **Mithral Full Plate +2**<br /><br />Full Plate is the heaviest of all mundane armor, and despite its great weight, it offers unparalleled protection against attacks. Mobility is not very easy in this type of armor and as such dexterity  while wearing full plates is highly restricted but they are to be worn by heavy infantry, and movement is not a priority. However, this magical specimen is made of mithral, a very rare, silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. As a result this full plate does not encumber more than a chain mail and is treated as a medium armor for purposes of movement and other limitations.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: -1<br />Weight: 30<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT14.png "Full Plate Mail +1") | **Full Plate Mail +1**<br /><br />Full plate armor is the best armor a warrior can buy, both in appearance and protection. The perfectly fitted interlocking plates are specially angled to deflect arrows and blows, and the entire suit is carefully adorned with rich engraving and embossed detail. With its magical enchantments, this suit of full plate is ideal for warriors.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 0<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT15.png "Pride of the Order +2") | **Pride of the Order +2**<br /><br />Bastion of Law, as it is called by those who do not belong to the Order, was originally created to be used by the most respected members of the Order of the Radian Heart. The suit gained its name in a glorious though bloody battle when few knights, all wearing armor of this type, stood against a seemingly unbeatable army of Orcs. Even when defeat was certain and all others allied troops ran amok in chaos the small group of deadpan knights continued to follow their commander's orders and fought until the sun set. Most of them died but their devotion to duty allowed the flying troops to reorganize themselves and when reinforcements finally arrived the Orc's army was crushed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to berserk & confusion effects<br /> Protection from Chaos: +2 bonus to AC and saving throws vs. chaotic creatures<br /><br />Armor Class: -1<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Lawful Good characters|
| *PLAT16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT16.png "Casiel's Soul +3") | **Casiel's Soul +3**<br /><br />These plates of blackened steel are fashioned with a slaver's cruelty to fit only those who seek the foul things of the world. This armor was known to be worn by Lord Casiel the Vile in his campaign against the Purple Dragon Knights of Cormyr. Upon Lord Casiel's death the armor was said to be destroyed, though it is also rumored that the vicious blackguard has joined the undead and still serves his unknown master.<br />The armor surrounds the wearer with crackling black energy from the negative plane that damages any living creature who strikes it, and makes its owner unaffected by spells and effects that deals with necromantic arts...which can be a blessing or a curse.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Death Armor: all living creatures who strike the wearer in melee suffer 1d4+2 points of cold damage<br /> Spell Immunity: Necromancy<br /><br />Armor Class: -2<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Evil-aligned characters|
| *PLAT17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT17.png "Armor of the Hart +3") | **Armor of the Hart +3**<br /><br />Few suits of armor in all the Realms are the equal of this full plate. All that remains of the origin of the Hart are folktales and legends. The most popular of these is that an impossible battle was once fought against an army of orcs surging through the Three Trees Pass. Arngor of the Oak led the armies of men and elves and it is said that he dueled with the orc commander till the sun set and the land was bathed in a bloody mist. Finally the orc fell but Arngor had sustained wounds too vast for any to save him. His blood soaked through the armor he wore, infusing it with his courage and nobility. Thus the Armor of the Hart became known to men.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to fear effects<br /> Heroic Inspiration: when the wearer drops below 50% hit points, he gains +2 bonus to hit, damage, and saving throws<br /><br />Armor Class: -2<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT19.png "Full Plate Mail +2") | **Full Plate Mail +2**<br /><br />Full plate armor is the best armor a warrior can buy, both in appearance and protection, and the enchantments on this suit are particularly powerful. The intricate engraving and spectacular embossing adorning the suit are of indeterminate origin, as is the armor itself. This +2 armor was created with the limited wish spell.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: -1<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT20.png "Blue Dragonplate Armor +5") | **Blue Dragonplate Armor +5**<br /><br />Blue Dragon Hide is lightweight, strong, and highly resistant to electricity. These suits are much sought after, but few smiths are willing to craft them. The necessary materials are rare and dangerous to acquire, and dragons have long memories where their kin are concerned. Most smiths would prefer not to even risk association with the trade in dragon hide. This full plate mail of natural-source can be worn by more classes than other similarly protective armors.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Electrical Resistance: +50%<br /><br />Armor Class: -4<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Shapeshifter<br /> Avenger<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT21.png "Enkidu's Full Plate +4") | **Enkidu's Full Plate +4**<br /><br />The first example of this item was created for Enkidu, a famed warrior of Kara-Tur. None dared challenge him in fair combat, but he was often subject to sneak attacks from assassins, ninjas, and wu-jen. His armor was designed to prevent such cowardly action from succeeding, protecting the wearer as well as the honor of the attacker who would otherwise shame himself. Copies have been made, though they vary in power when compared to the original.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to backstab<br /> Protects Against Critical Hits<br /><br />Armor Class: -3<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *PLAT23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/PLAT23.png "Full Plate Mail +3") | **Full Plate Mail +3**<br /><br />Full plate armor is the best armor a warrior can buy, both in appearance and protection, and the enchantments on this suit are particularly powerful. The intricate engraving and spectacular embossing adorning the suit are of indeterminate origin, as is the armor itself.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: -2<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
| *WA2PLAT*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WA2PLAT.png "Plate of Balduran +2") | **Plate of Balduran +2**<br /><br />No one really knows what fate befell Balduran, the founder of Baldur's Gate, but people never grow tired of speculating. When his personal armor was found on the Sword Coast - supposedly recovered and sold by a group of adventurers - it only served to spark interest in him once again, and several copies of the suit were made to accommodate collectors and historians. In this way, it could be said, Balduran obtained a measure of immortality.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: +1 bonus<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +5 bonus<br /> Magic Resistance: +5% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: -1<br />Weight: 60<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Archer<br /> Stalker<br /> Barbarian<br /> Beast Master<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|
