His success, or so he claimed, was due to the mobility that his light armor afforded him. He may well have been unaware of the suit's magical qualities, but his peers ignored his claims of ignorance when enchantments were discovered. The armor survived the subsequent beating, whereas Karajah did not.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Dexterity: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus vs. breath<br /><br />Armor Class: 6<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 4 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Shapeshifter|

| *LEAT14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT14.png "Skin of the Forest +3") | **Skin of the Forest +3**<br /><br />This was the armor of Seffer Ekr, and a sign of the goddess Mielikki's favor. She had rewarded the ranger's loyalty with the promise that he would never die in battle, and he defied death for many years, holding hordes of monsters back from his home forest. A heart attack claimed him when his time was done, not an enemy's blade.<br /><br />Note: Barkskin effect is not cumulative with other similar magic.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Barkskin: wielder's skin becames as tough as bark, increasing its Armor Class by 4<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 4 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Shapeshifter|

| *LEAT22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT22.png "Human Flesh") | **Human Flesh**<br /><br />This is a tunic made from the badly sewn together human flesh that you took from the Tanner's house in the Bridge District. If completed it may make serviceable armor, albeit only the most evil of humans could wear such a vile item.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 9<br />Weight: 5<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Evil Characters|

# Modded Studded Leather Armor
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *LEAT04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT04.png "Studded Leather Armor") | **Studded Leather Armor**<br /><br />Studded leather armor has little in common with normal leather armor. Instead of a hardened shell, studded leather offers hundreds of metal rivets affixed to a supple backing. The numerous studs form a flexible coat of metal that helps to turn aside slashing and cutting attacks, while the leather is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 7<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT05.png "Studded Leather Armor +1") | **Studded Leather Armor +1**<br /><br />Studded leather armor has little in common with normal leather armor. Instead of a hardened shell, studded leather offers hundreds of metal rivets affixed to a supple backing. The numerous studs form a flexible coat of metal that helps to turn aside slashing and cutting attacks, while the leather is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place. Magical enchantments have improved the protective abilities of this particular suit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 6<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT06.png "Armor of Missile Attraction +3") | **Armor of Missile Attraction +3**<br /><br />This odd looking suit of studded leather cannot be removed once put on, through a Remove Curse spell. While improving the protection against all melee weapons, this armor actually becomes a target for missile weapons, and hence so does its wearer. The choice is simple, deadly arrows or deadly swords.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Missile Attraction: -10 penalty to armor class vs. missiles, creatures within 20' gain +4 bonus to armor class vs. missiles<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT07.png "Studded Leather Armor +2") | **Studded Leather Armor +2**<br /><br />Studded leather armor has little in common with normal leather armor. Instead of a hardened shell, studded leather offers hundreds of metal rivets affixed to a supple backing. The numerous studs form a flexible coat of metal that helps to turn aside slashing and cutting attacks, while the leather is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place. Magical enchantments have greatly improved the protective abilities of this particular suit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT08.png "Shadow Armor +3") | **Shadow Armor +3**<br /><br />The Shadow Thieves of Amn are known to have deep pockets, and while they may employ countless gutter thugs and petty crooks, their elite core members are equipped very well indeed. Items such as Shadow Armor have occasionally been recovered from events where their involvement was suspected, though guild leaders have never confirmed or denied ownership.<br />Shadow Armors are powerful suits created for use by the Shadowmasters of Amn, who are at the highest levels of the Shadow Thief hierarchy. The essence of night has been woven into this dark suit so that it feels and looks like normal armor but actually encloses the wearer in a mass of twisting shadows. The resulting almost insubstantial armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Shadow Armor: allows arcane spellcasting without penalties, and grants +10% bonus to hide in shadows<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 0<br />Usable By:<br /> Thief|
| *LEAT15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT15.png "Studded Leather Armor +3") | **Studded Leather Armor +3**<br /><br />This armor is the standard armor given out to griffin riders and other elite warriors who use mounted steeds. It is lightweight but offers good protection, especially with the extra magical protections crafted upon it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT16.png "Orc Leather +2") | **Orc Leather +2**<br /><br />This ghastly armor was taken from an orc camp destroyed by barbarians. Instead of standard metal rivets, like normal studded leather, this orc leather is instead laced with hundreds of fire hardened bones. Finger bones, ribs, and skulls cover the armor, acting much like the traditional metal rivets. Powerful orcish enchantments give the armor special resistance to physical blows, but the repulsiveness of the armor reduces the wearer's charisma.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: -1 penalty<br /> Physical Damage Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT17.png "Armor of Deep Night +5") | **Armor of Deep Night +5**<br /><br />Enchanted ebony rivets adorn the black leather of this armor that belonged to Dami Darn, a skilled and feared mercenary killer. She was frequently hired to hush up quarrels between guilds and countless burglars, thieves, and even assassins fell at her hands. She made herself so many enemies that she had this studded leather armor enchanted in order to avoid being killed by her own methods. Her potential killers were left with no choice but to fight her openly, though most met their end before attempting this.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to backstab<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 25<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT18.png "Armor of the Viper +4") | **Armor of the Viper +4**<br /><br />This armor's namesake is a serpent only in manner, referring to the Drow assassin Raroh. Poison was his trademark, and he had this suit enchanted consequently without revealing its properties to anyone.<br />Raroh taught everything he knew about the art of killing and the secrets to create the most lethal of poisons to Avlorm, the most promising novice assassin within his own guild. But when Avlorm's power eventually threatened his own, Raroh had to teach his pupil the last lesson of his life. Avlorm and a few trained assassins planned to kill their master within his own house, with the aid of the night and the best poison they could brew. Unfortunately for them Raroh was well aware of this, and thanks to this suit's immunity to venom, their poisoned darts and blades couldn't harm him. Subsequentely he easily dispatched all of them entwisting them in a poisonous cloud of ghastly, green vapors, and landing the killing blows with bare hands.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Cloudkill<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to poison effects<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 25<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Avenger<br /> Shapeshifter|

# Modded Hide Armor
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *LEAT10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT10.png "Hide Armor") | **Hide Armor**<br /><br />Hide Armor is made from the thick skin of large animals (elephants, for example) or layers of thinner, more common leather. It is considered too cumbersome for use in advanced human cultures, but is common among more barbaric humanoids. It offers better protection than normal leather, but can be hard to maintain, often resulting in an offensive odor or shoddy appearance that prevents effective use. Thieves can wear this armor, but it has a negative effect on their abilities.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 6<br />Weight: 25<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT13.png "Skin of the Ghoul +2") | **Skin of the Ghoul +2**<br /><br />A clever thief, Damien Oneknife always tried to gain from the assets of his enemies, no matter the circumstances. After an intense battle with several ghouls in which two of his companions perished, Damien decided to even the odds in future encounters. He skinned what he thought to be their leader and brought the hide to a halfling armorer talented in enchanting leather. When the suit was finished it was magically protective against physical attacks and paralyzation, but the stink of death and corruption surrounding it was overwhelming. Damien got accustomed to this ghastly stench and though he never wore this armor in public, he found it very effective when adventuring. Not very epic perhaps, but practical.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: -2 penalty<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus vs. paralyzation<br /> Stench: living creatures within 10 feet must save vs. death or suffer -2 penalty to attack rolls and 20% spell failure<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 4 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT19.png "Shadow Dragonhide Armor +5") | **Shadow Dragonhide Armor +5**<br /><br />This suit of hide armor is formed from interlocking shadow dragon scales. Lighter and less encumbrant than most hide armors, shadow dragonhide armor also protects the wearer from negative energy attacks. Suits such as this are much sought after, but few smiths are willing to craft them. The necessary materials are rare and dangerous to acquire, and dragons have long memories where their kin are concerned. Most smiths would prefer not to even risk association with the trade in dragon hide.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to level drain effects<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT20.png "Aeger's Hide +3") | **Aeger's Hide +3**<br /><br />This heavy and thick bear hide is all that remains of the fabled Aeger. Several hundred years ago the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast. The bear was possessed by a seemingly unstoppable fury and it was invulnerable to fire, cold, electricity and acid. Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong. The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain. Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves. Out of one of the pieces this armor was created.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Strength: +1 bonus<br /> Elemental Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 30<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Shapeshifter|
| *LEAT23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/LEAT23.png "Trollhide Armor +4") | **Trollhide Armor +4**<br /><br />Some might argue that trolls are the natural enemy of most rangers. Inherently violent and aggressive, trolls frequently attack with little or no provocation. They attack humans and small human settlements regularly, destroying everything in their path. Trolls are not only feared for their large, powerful limbs, but for their ability to rapidly regenerate most wounds inflicted on them. This magically enhanced suit of armor, made with the thick hide of trolls, grants the wearer the same regenerative properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Acid Resistance: -15% penalty<br /> Fire Resistance: -15% penalty<br /> Regeneration: wearer regenerates 1 hit point every 3 seconds<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 25<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk<br /> Shapeshifter|
