| *SHLD24*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD24.png "Reflection Shield +1") | **Reflection Shield +1**<br /><br />Thought only a decoration from some forgotten festhall, this shield languished in the backroom of a shop until a young noble purchased it as parade armor. Its dormant enchantments were discovered when a later attempt on his life was foiled as the shield reflected away each attack back at the would-be assassins. Subsequent study has linked it to Myth Rhynn, or perhaps some other ancient excavation.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Deflect Missiles: deflects ranged weapons<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 2<br />Special: No Piercing Attack Protection<br />Weight: 4<br />Requires: 4 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|

| *SHLD26*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD26.png "Nature's Ward +2") | **Nature's Ward +2**<br /><br />In the ancient days when the Ashenwood was young, and there were those who still called them 'green elves' - shields like these were worn by an order of wild elven druids and rangers dedicated to protecting the forest and its inhabitants. Now little is left of the order but their memory, and replicas of their gear... and the knowledge of how the Ashenwood has grown and flourished in the ages that have followed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Nature's Blessing: +2 bonus to AC and saving throws vs. unnatural creatures<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *SHLD27*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD27.png "Saving Grace +3") | **Saving Grace +3**<br /><br />Shield of Dawn<br />Shields like this are first mentioned in ancient liturgies of Amaunator, in which the god's champions bear radiant shields against an infestation of undead. The shields made their first appearance in modern times in dramatic fashion, appearing miraculously at the altars of several of the deity's temples in the Year of Smoldering Spells, 1020 DR. Since that time a number have been lost in battle, and not a few were stolen by foul creatures to prevent their use.<br />Once a holy artifact used by the elite sect of clerics and holy warriors called Sunmasters, part of the enchantments fled with their god's demise, but it still remain a powerful tool for any adventurer.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Searing Light: all who attack the wearer in melee must save vs. spell or be blinded for 1 round, undead creatures also suffer 2d6 points of damage<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 4<br />Special: No Missile Weapon Protection<br />Weight: 6<br />Requires: 4 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *SHLD28*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD28.png "Small Shield +2") | **Small Shield +2**<br /><br />Despite the effectiveness of the enchantments on this shield, it is otherwise nondescript and defies precise identification. Such standardization makes it likely that it is from the militia of some forgotten barony, though it is hard to be certain.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Special: No Missile Weapon Protection<br />Weight: 6<br />Requires: 4 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|

A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft shield is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wearer exceptional protection. Drowcraft shields will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: increased armor class<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 5<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|

| *SHLD03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD03.png "Medium Shield") | **Medium Shield**<br /><br />A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield. Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using his shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield. Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from 3'-4' in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a spread dragon's wings. A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|

| *SHLD21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD21.png "Dragon Scale Shield +2") | **Dragon Scale Shield +2**<br /><br />Another powerful item created by the warlock Wormsor, this shield consists of red dragon skin stretched over a heavy shield frame. The red background is adorned in a pattern that, when looked in the right way, reveals the face of an ancient dragon. Crafted to withstand a mighty red dragon's breath the shield is able to drop off its effects as well as absorbing and nullifying shock waves of any kind of source (wing buffets, physical blows, telekinesis, etc.).<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Force Absorbing: wielder gets +2 bonus to saves vs. breath and is immune to everything, magical and otherwise, that pushes him away<br /> Fire Resistance: +30% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Weight: 10<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *SHLD22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD22.png "Shield of Balduran +2") | **Shield of Balduran +2**<br /><br />Balduran, a legendary seafaring explorer, was the first native of Faerun to set foot on the lands known as Anchorome and made the trek up to Sossal. He returned full of tales and vast wealth, and put forth a large sum of money to protect his sparsely-settled home harbor town. Then he set sail of Anchorome again and has never been seen again. His money was well spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.<br /><br />This shield was reputedly worn by Balduran, and like most of his equipment it holds powerful enchantments.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *SHLD29*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD29.png "Medium Shield +2") | **Medium Shield +2**<br /><br />A standard magical shield given to elite troops and bodyguards, this particular shield is relatively new. Forged recently by Taerom Fuiruim of Beregost, this shield has few stories to tell. Perhaps it will take a brave young warrior to perform legendary deeds while wearing it, to finally give it a history.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *SHLD32*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD32.png "Shield of the Order +4") | **Shield of the Order +4**<br /><br />Peragath the Valiant, a great champion of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, carried this shield into battle against a horde of invading Tanar'ri pouring through a gate to the Astral Plane. Gripped by holy fervor, the mighty paladin single handedly drove back the horde, then foolishly leapt through the Astral gate to finish them off. The gate collapsed, and both Peragath and the shield were forever lost in the Planes.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Protection from Demons: +2 bonus to AC and saving throws vs. demonic creatures and fallen celestials<br /> Memorize one extra spell of each level from 1st to 4th<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 5<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *WA2SHIEL*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WA2SHIEL.png "Mirror Shield +3") | **Mirror Shield +3**<br /><br />Angwile the Artificer was widely known among the svirfneblin as the foremost authority on beholders. While he was often derided during his lifetime as foolhardy and reckless, his studies of captive beholders led to the creation of many artifacts that are to this day highly sought after by deep gnomes and other denizens of the Underdark.<br />Among Angwile's most well-known creation there's the Mirror Shield. This shield looks and works like a normal shield, but instead of a coat-of-arms, the front is mirror-reflective, and the inside is crystal clear. The wearer can cover behind the shield and look through its clear surface, while beholder's rays are deflected away, and gaze attacks are nullified as opponents see their own reflected image.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to ray and gaze attacks<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 4<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|

| *SHLD05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD05.png "Large Shield") | **Large Shield**<br /><br />The body shield, also known as the kite or tower shield, is a massive metal or wooden shield reaching nearly from the chin to the toe of the user. It must be firmly fastened to the forearm and the shield hand must firmly grip it at all times. Naturally, this precludes use of the shield hand for anything but holding the body shield in places and fighting results more difficult because of the shield's encumbrance.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Special: +1 vs. Missile Weapons<br />Weight: 45<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|

During a fierce battle between a human cavalry division and a hobgoblin horde, the young man was sent for reinforcements. He was beset by a cascade of arrows that nearly blocked out the sun, and he knew that even if he avoided the arrows himself, should his horse fall he would surely be doomed. With his shield and body he positioned himself to take the brunt of the onslaught, and was mortally wounded for it. His horse remained unscathed allowing for their escape, and his body was carried back to the nearest town, where he was resurrected from death.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Shield Others: allies within 6 feet gain +2 bonus to armor class<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Special: +1 vs. Missile Weapons<br />Weight: 45<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|

| *SHLD19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD19.png "Dwarven Shield +2") | **Dwarven Shield +2**<br /><br />This dwarven-made shield was commissioned by Pellan of Tyr, a brash paladin known for unquestioning courage and an almost total lack of common sense. Upon hearing that a red dragon was ravaging the countryside, Pellan mounted his horse and rode off to do battle. As it happened, Pellan and his armor digested readily enough, but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps. Subsequently coughed up, it lay in a hoard for years until retrieved by Pellan's son, a warrior who knew when to sneak.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *SHLD23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD23.png "Fortress Shield +3") | **Fortress Shield +3**<br /><br />This shield, as tall as a man, is aptly named. With it, Phil Pious, a paladin of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, once held a marauding battalion of hobgoblin and kobold archers at bay till they exhausted their arrows. As the shield is almost as useful in melee as it is at range, he then slew each and every creature.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Physical Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 4<br />Special: +1 vs. Missile Weapons<br />Weight: 45<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *SHLD30*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD30.png "Large Shield +2") | **Large Shield +2**<br /><br />A shield of the elite Calimport Standing Dragoons mercenary company, a group long since disbanded due to political backstabbing. Having the best of equipment, their shields were extremely light and powerfully protective in combat. The size of the shield precludes the use of the shield hand for anything else and fighting results more difficult because of the shield's encumbrance.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Special: +1 vs. Missile Weapons<br />Weight: 25<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *SHLD31*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SHLD31.png "Darksteel Shield +4") | **Darksteel Shield +4**<br /><br />The dwarven clan of Clangeddin were famous for their work in darksteel, a material not to be found anywhere but within the Clangeddin clan homes within the Marching Mountains. In their efforts to find more and more darksteel, the Clangeddin delved ever deeper into the bowels of the earth.<br />It was on one such expedition that the seven sons of Argeld Heavyhand, the Clangeddin leader, were lost. The only survivor from the ill-fated expedition was Glimred Heavyhand, youngest son of Argeld. The lad returned with tales of drow and illithid and other darker, nameless horrors the like of which had never before been seen.<br />Desperate as he was to avenge his sons, Argeld could not send more of his people down into the depths of the mountain to face such horrors. Glimred himself, however, could not be dissuaded. To aid Glimred in his quest for vengeance, the dwarven smiths set about constructing the Darksteel Shield, a heavily enchanted shield that provides more protection than most suits of armor.<br />But Glimred was impatient, his lust for vengeance could not be deferred, and he disappeared into the bowels of the Marching Mountains before the work was completed, never to be seen again. The disappearance and presumed death of his sole surviving son proved too much for Argeld, who died from the grief of a broken heart.<br />With their leader dead and their hero Glimred gone, the dwarves knew it was only a matter of time before their clan was overrun by their Underdark enemies. Before dispersing across the face of Faerun, the clan sold the shield to the highest bidder - though the dwarven smiths to this day have refused to divulge the mysterious buyer's identity.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Elemental Resistance: +20% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 5<br />Special: +1 vs. Missile Weapons<br />Weight: 45<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
