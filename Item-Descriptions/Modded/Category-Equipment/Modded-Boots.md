| *BOOT01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT01.png "Boots of Speed") | **Boots of Speed**<br /><br />The Paws of the Cheetah<br />These enchanted boots were once the property of a deadly Sword Coast assassin who purportedly moved with such speed that his targets often didn't have the opportunity to respond, even if on horseback. Over time the assassin's fame spread, and though his name was never known, all knew to fear the words last heard by his victims: "You can hide, but you cannot run!". These boots were the source of his ability, though it is also believed that he formed an elite guild wherein each member was equipped identically, thus explaining why he was not just fast, but could seemingly appear in several places at once.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Movement Rate: +4 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Usable By:<br /> All|
| *BOOT02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT02.png "Boots of Stealth") | **Boots of Stealth**<br /><br />Worn Whispers<br />In ages past, a king named Rhigaerd was renowned for the spies he kept. So skillful were they, that no nook or cranny escaped their eyes, and maps were held for entire castles and towns. Eventually betrayed from within, the tools of their trade were taken and dispersed, ensuring that none could amass such a band again.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Move Silently: +40% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Usable By:<br /> Thief<br /> Ranger<br /> Monk|
| *BOOT03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT03.png "Boots of the North") | **Boots of the North**<br /><br />The Frost's Embrace<br />Stranded by his company for a sack of gold, Daviol the Frozen was left for dead in the midst of the Great Glacier. His dying curse echoed across the barren wastelands to the ear of Auril, Goddess of Winter. She smiled upon him, and his bare body was protected and preserved by a pair of these enchanted boots of the north. With them he crossed the ice land in pursuit of his would be murderers. Driven by rage, Daviol took his revenge upon his previous friends as they warmed themselves in a tavern of the closest city. After his thirst for blood was quenched, he continued to travel the frozen land, never to be seen again.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Cold Resistance: +50% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Usable By:<br /> All|
| *BOOT04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT04.png "Boots of Avoidance") | **Boots of Avoidance**<br /><br />Elves' Bane<br />An infamous highwayman in his day, Pandar of Scardale made quite a name for himself vexing the elves of Cormanthor forest. To their annoyance, he continually used the wood to escape the law; and with the aid of these boots, the elves' arrows as well. Unfortunately for Pandar, pit-traps and starvation proved a slower, but effective, substitute.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +4 bonus vs. missile<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Usable By:<br /> All|
| *BOOT05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT05.png "Boots of Grounding") | **Boots of Grounding**<br /><br />Talos' Gift<br />Untold years ago, the Fortress of the Starspire Peninsula was placed under the direct torment of Talos when a favored Stormherald was murdered there. Talos promised the destruction of the city by earthquakes, its isolation by tidal waves, and the death of its citizens by storms. One pair of these boots was bestowed to ensure that none but a single man would survive to tell the story of his wrath. Later, travelers seeking fortune in the ruined city came upon an aged man, maddened by the continuous destruction around him; the boots he wore would carry to many a distant land the legend of a city consumed by a god's rage.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Electricity Resistance: +50% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Usable By:<br /> All|
| *BOOT07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT07.png "Boots of Elvenkind") | **Boots of Elvenkind**<br /><br />Several pairs of this type of boots were made for elven battalions during the Year of Singing Arrows, 884 DR. These boots allow their wearer to walk freely and silently among the briars and thorns of the most dense forests, and the scouts equipped with this stealthy footwear turned the tide of at least two major battles against Sembian mercenaries. Thieves love to get their hands on these boots, but the elves are reluctant about exporting them, fearful that they may be used for illegal purposes.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Dexterity: +1 bonus<br /> Move Silently: +20% bonus<br /> Protection from Spell: Entangle<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Usable By:<br /> Monk<br /> Ranger<br /> Thief|
| *BOOT08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT08.png "Boots of Phasing") | **Boots of Phasing**<br /><br />This item is cursed and can only be removed with a remove curse spell. Whether by mistake or malicious purposes the creator of these boots enchanted them with dangerous magic. When worn the wearer is constantly teleported from opponent to opponent, until either the wearer or all opponents in sight are slain. However, due to the boots' ability to phase striking the wearer becomes much more difficult.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /> Blink: when enemies are on sight the wearer phases to a random opponent every 2 rounds<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Usable By:<br /> All|
| *BOOT11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT11.png "Boots of Etherealness") | **Boots of Etherealness**<br /><br />Boots of the Plane Strider<br />Said to be sewn together from scraps of the planes themselves, these strange boots not only grant their user the ability to shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, but allow the wearer to remain anchored to whichever Plane he wishes. Why these boots were ever made has long been the subject of speculation among the sages of Candlekeep. Some suggest that a certain noblewoman was gifted them by an ethereal lover, so that she could join him for a tryst. Others simply point out that the boots are useful for any plane-traveling adventurer.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Etherealness: wearer becomes ethereal for 5 rounds. While in this state he is immune to normal and magical weapons, has 100% magic resistance and improved invisibility. He is also unable to attack or cast spell.<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Dimensional Anchor: wearer is unaffected by Teleport Field, Maze, Imprisonment and similar effects<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Usable By:<br /> All|
| *BOOT12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOOT12.png "Gargoyle Boots") | **Gargoyle Boots**<br /><br />Legend holds that the mage who created this magical footwear trapped the spirit of an actual gargoyle within these boots. Unfortunately, they couldn't protect the nameless wizard from the vengeance of the gargoyle's mate. As there are multiple variations on the Gargolyle Boots, it is assumed that the tale is, though entertaining, a mere fabrication - an interesting way to explain the magical toughness that the boots provide.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (twice per day):<br /> Stoneskin (5 skins, 1 turn)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to backstab<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Usable By:<br /> All|
