| *NPRING01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPRING01.png "De'Arnise Signet Ring") | **De'Arnise Signet Ring**<br /><br />This ring was given to Nalia by her father upon her ascension to adulthood. Bonded to her blood as it is, the ring may not be removed from Nalia, nor its powers used by anyone else.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Luck: +2 bonus (+10% for skills)<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Nalia|
| *RING02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING02.png "Ring of Fire Resistance") | **Ring of Fire Resistance**<br /><br />Batalista's Passport<br />The grand mage Batalista intended this item to aid him in his travels in the plane of fire, and it is said he repeatedly summoned a Salamander from that realm to aid in the construction of the ring. Salamanders are not known for their patience; hence, it was unwise for Batalista to pester his "instructor" quite so much. The finger bearing the finished ring was indeed untouched by the inferno that claimed his tower. Had that finger still been attached, Batalista himself might have fared better.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +50% bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING03.png "Band of the Forest") | **Band of the Forest**<br /><br />Druid's Ring<br />This slender band of green metal has a strange, organic warmth to it - more like a vine than a circle of steel. A druid order in Cormanthor is said to guard the secret to the construction of these rings, which have never been seen in the possession of anyone outside their immediate membership. How this particular ring escaped the protection of their forest is unknown, but there are rumors that an outcast could have brought it into exile with him.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Memorize one extra spell of each level from 1st to 4th<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Ranger|
| *RING04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING04.png "Ring of Clumsiness") | **Ring of Clumsiness**<br /><br />The Jester's Folly<br />The most notorious owner of this ring made a substantial living exploiting its nature. Gregoria the Foole, a jester by trade, would use his incomparable sleight of hand to switch this ring with that of a patsy taken from his audience. The rest of his performance would involve the mocking of the newly clumsy individual, much to the delight of their comrades. The ring was removed only once the stooge had promised no reprisals for the treatment he had received; though Gregoria frequently still had to make a hasty retreat. His last known performance was rumored to have been an ill-humored mage in Zhentil Keep; a show from which he did not flee quite fast enough.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Strength: -1 penalty<br /> Dexterity: +3 bonus<br /> Constitution: -2 penalty<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING05.png "Ring of Invisibility") | **Ring of Invisibility**<br /><br />Sandthief's Ring<br />Though there are numerous examples of such rings, this one may have come from a set once owned by a master thief that worked Waterdhavian crowds in broad daylight, replacing purses with bags of sand. Once thought retired, it is now suspected that the so-called "Sand Thief" was eventually killed for not joining a local thieves' guild, and that his rings were seized by a group that abused his methods liberally.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (three times per day):<br /> Invisibility<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING06.png "Ring of Protection +1") | **Ring of Protection +1**<br /><br />Amulets, cloaks and rings of this sort are infused with protective spells, and are among the most popular and numerous magic items on the market. The original design may have originated in the earliest of arcane guilds, but the current makers of these items are varied and widespread. Unfortunately multiple protective enchantments of these kind don't stack, and thus no other amulet, cloak, or ring of protection can be worn while wearing this ring.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING07.png "Ring of Protection +2") | **Ring of Protection +2**<br /><br />The Guard's Ring<br />The Guard was an immortal sentry assigned to protect a tomb that sheltered the body of a princess of the Akanal. As time passed, respect for the grave disappeared with the memory of the royal family, and adventurers began to try their luck with the Guard. It was inevitable that he would eventually be bested, and when he was, the ring he wore was one of many treasures taken from the tomb.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING08.png "Ring of Wizardry") | **Ring of Wizardry**<br /><br />Everlasting Memory<br />Long ago, a grand wizard from Amn was rumored to have defied Mystra's limitations on the magical arts. Legends spoke of this wizard being able to cast spells without the limitation of memorization. In the end it was found that his powers stemmed from the several magical rings that he had made for himself. His proclaimed "everlasting memory" was a hoax, though his rings continue to be one of the most sought after items.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Memorize one extra spell of each level from 1st to 4th<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *RING09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING09.png "Ring of Free Action") | **Ring of Free Action**<br /><br />Edventar's Gift<br />This ring was given to the reef scavenger and hunter known only as Edventar by a group of aquatic elves long his friends. His help in routing the "Pirate Queen" Yenandra of Dambrath was instrumental in their survival, though Yenandra continues to be feared anywhere the water meets land.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Free Action: the wearer is immune to everything, magical and otherwise, that limits his mobility in any way<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING20.png "Ring of Energy") | **Ring of Energy**<br /><br />The Victor<br />Crafted by Drow mages of the Underdark, this weapon was used in an arranged battle between two rival houses. Each combatant was allowed to use a single magic item to aid his efforts. This ring was the weapon used by the victor of the contest, though he never laid hands on it. It was worn by his sibling and fired from the crowd, striking his opponent squarely in the back. Everyone witnessing agreed it was a brilliant interpretation of the rules.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Energy Blast: inflicts 2D6 points of magic damage to one target<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Damage Resistance: +20% bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING21.png "Night's Embrace") | **Night's Embrace**<br /><br />This ring is as dark as the night sky. When donned, it grants its wearer the ability to see perfectly in the dark and blend easily into the shadows. Though a common item among rogues and others who wish to go unnoticed, this item is rapidly becoming standard equipment among the Night Masks, according to the Westgate city watch.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Infravision<br /> Hide In Shadows: +40% bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING22.png "Ring of Holiness") | **Ring of Holiness**<br /><br />Every God Ring<br />Rings such as these are one of the most well kept secrets among the pious. For in order for these rings to be created they must be blessed by all the known gods. This can cause problems, especially for those faiths that conflict with each other. It's not surprising that those who choose to don the ring refuse to reveal its origins for fear of being persecuted by their own brethren.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Memorize one extra spell of each level from 1st to 4th<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Paladin|
| *RING23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING23.png "Ring of Folly") | **Ring of Folly**<br /><br />Discipliner<br />Oft the bane of the careless mage, this ring was actually used to promote humility. Hergat Norin, a grand wizard of Narfell, would give the Discipliner to his most skilled, and most egotistical, students. Through their blind arrogance they would mistake the ring as a reward for their "obvious brilliance," and not the punishment of a disapproving teacher.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Casting Speed: +1 bonus<br /> Wild Magic: any spell cast by the wearer is affected by a wild surge<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING25*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING25.png "Ring of Opportunity") | **Ring of Opportunity**<br /><br />Ring of Opportunity<br />This ring was given to <CHARNAME> by Koveras in Candlekeep. Its polished black surface is cold to the touch and engraved with powerful incantations. The ring's design and crafting material suggest western workmanship. On the inside you see what appears to be a thick figure eight with a slash mark through it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /> <br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Luck: +1 bonus (+5% for skills)<br /> <br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING26*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING26.png "Ring of Djinni Summoning") | **Ring of Djinni Summoning**<br /><br />An item out of fables, the Djinni ring is highly sought after. Once a day the wearer of this beautiful ring can summon a Djinni who will perform a Limited Wish as desired.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Limited Wish<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING27*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING27.png "Ring of Fire Control") | **Ring of Fire Control**<br /><br />Elementals make for powerful foes but with this ring they can become valuable allies. Dark tales tell of groups of Red Wizards all with rings of elemental command descending upon small villages with no warning and destroying every living thing in sight. Although the truth of these rumors is questionable the fact remains that a ring of this power in the wrong hands is dangerous, and that copies of these rings are created by the Red Wizards of Thay indeed and are sold in their enclaves across the realms.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental<br /> Fire Shield (Red)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +50% bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|

Dark tales tell of groups of Red Wizards all with rings of elemental command descending upon small villages with no warning and destroying every living thing in sight. Although the truth of these rumors is questionable the fact remains that a ring of this power in the wrong hands is dangerous, and that copies of these rings are created by the Red Wizards of Thay indeed and are sold in their enclaves across the realms.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Conjure Lesser Air Elemental<br /> Gaseous Form<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Protection from Spell: Stinking Cloud, Cloudkill, Acid Fog, Incendiary Cloud<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING29*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING29.png "Ring of Earth Control") | **Ring of Earth Control**<br /><br />Elementals make for powerful foes but with this ring they can become valuable allies. Dark tales tell of groups of Red Wizards all with rings of elemental command descending upon small villages with no warning and destroying every living thing in sight.

| *RING30*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING30.png "Ring of Human Influence") | **Ring of Human Influence**<br /><br />For seven years Count Fisfnilt searched the Realms for a suitable bride for his son Ewnin. Unfortunately all the women that Fisfnilt found were not up to the standards set by Ewnin, an impossibly spoiled man.

| *RING31*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING31.png "Ring of Regeneration") | **Ring of Regeneration**<br /><br />A lowly ranked Red Mage named Huhhus is said to have discovered the perfect way to distill troll flesh to make a potion that provides the same regenerative ability as that of the troll. Few were willing to drink the vile liquid, however. Decades later, a student of Huhhus created this ring, building upon the foundations of knowledge laid by Huhhus. Within the hollow cavity of the jade ring floats the ichor and brains of a troll, providing a limited regenerative capability to the wearer.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Regeneration: wearer regenerates 1 hit point every round<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING33*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING33.png "Ring of the Ram") | **Ring of the Ram**<br /><br />Also known as the Breaker of Castles, with one word this ring can unleash fantastic and deadly powers. When it is triggered, a barely discernible ram-like shape billows forth from the ring.

| *RING34*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING34.png "Derek's Ring of Spell Turning") | **Derek's Ring of Spell Turning**<br /><br />A gift to Derek Poodon, apprentice warrior, this ring was his salvation when he stumbled upon two Red Wizards traveling the Cloakwood Forest. Enraged at being disturbed, the mages unleashed a score of Magic Missiles at the seemingly helpless Derek, but to their brief surprise, the assault reflected back and killed them both. Thereafter, without having lifted his blade, Derek was rather sheepishly known as Derek the Red Slayer.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Spell Turning<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING35*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING35.png "Ring of the Burglar") | **Ring of the Burglar**<br /><br />Derek Drak, one of the most talented burglars in the Shadow Thieves, wore this ring on many of his scores. The ring enhanced Derek's already impressive dexterity, and in the city of Athkatla there wasn't a door that could not be unlocked by him.

| *RING39*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING39.png "Ring of Kangaxx") | **Ring of Kangaxx**<br /><br />This ring is relatively unadorned, but the vile magic within radiates intense evil. Indeed, its creator, Kangaxx, was no less evil himself, even before millennia of undeath honed his power. It is said that a cadre of Netheril mages fought and imprisoned the demilich once, but being unable to destroy him fully, they became liches themselves to stand guard over his remains. It may have been the construction of this ring which originally drew their enmity, as each of the gem's nine facets was supposedly empowered by sacrifice and death.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities:<br /> Finger of Death (once per day)<br /> Vampiric Touch (three times per day)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /> Immunity to disease & poison effects<br /> Regeneration: wearer regenerates 1 hit point every round<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING40*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING40.png "Ring of Acuity") | **Ring of Acuity**<br /><br />Reaching Ring<br />The origins of this ring are unclear, and while its enchantments share similarities with historical examples of Rings of Wizardry, there is something strange in how it feels, either in the weight of the metal or in the aura it projects, and it does not function the same. It was likely found on some distant plane, and as such, its maker will remain a mystery.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Memorize one extra spell of each level from 5th to 7th<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *RING41*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING41.png "Ring of Protection +3") | **Ring of Protection +3**<br /><br />The Warder's Signet<br />Legend holds that this plain gold band was a gift from Ao to Helm as a reward for the God's stalwart service during the Time of Troubles. Helm, in turn, diluted and divided the ring and passed the gift on to his mortal followers. Scholars outside the church argue that Ao seems above emotion or gratitude, and chalk the story up to propaganda for the faithful.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +3 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +3 bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RING42*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING42.png "Ring of the Phantom Wraith") | **Ring of the Phantom Wraith**<br /><br />The Specter's Ring<br />A ruthless assassin of Tethyr known only as the Specter used this ring to great effect many years ago.

| *RING44*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING44.png "Heartwood Ring") | **Heartwood Ring**<br /><br />Combined with the Nymph's Tear, this simple band of oak allows a druid to draw upon the natural energies of the world around them.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Elemental Resistance: +10% bonus<br /> Memorize one extra spell of each level from 5th to 7th<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Druids|
| *RING46*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RING46.png "Larloch's Soul Stealer") | **Larloch's Soul Stealer**<br /><br />Larloch, the infamous necromancer turned lich, had an insatiable need for new souls for his research. The means he used to tear them from their living bodies and capture them are as myriad as they are terrifying. The uninitiated dabble with Larloch's artifacts at their own peril.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +10 bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Soul Stealing: wearer's melee hits drain 1D4 hit points from the target and transfers it to the wielder<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *WA2RING*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WA2RING.png "Mercykiller Ring") | **Mercykiller Ring**<br /><br />The Mercykillers are a powerful faction based out of the planar city of Sigil who believe in justice and retribution at the expense of all else. Their name comes from their credo that mercy is for the weak, and the merciful should be punished. This ring is given out to Mercykiller assassins when they are sent out to punish those who have broken the laws of Sigil. Often these assassins will roam as far as the Prime Material plane.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Move Silently: +20% bonus<br /> Hide in Shadows: +20% bonus<br /> Detect Illusions: +20% bonus<br /> Set Traps: +20% bonus<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Thief|
