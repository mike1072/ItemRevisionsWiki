The archers, each equipped with an enchanted bow and bracers, hid within range of the gathering.

| *BRAC11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BRAC11.png "Bracers of Speed") | **Bracers of Speed**<br /><br />The origin of these bracers is said to be the underdark. Such items have sometimes been donated by the Drow nobility as fair recompensation to those who offered their services to support their cause. Once worn, they come as a significant help in battle granting an almost unsustainable speed to attacks, and will definitely remind the wearer of the long enduring gratitude of its creators. Some of these generous drows find it amusing to then conjure a horde of small mutated spiders...<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> THAC0: -4 penalty<br /> Attacks per Round: +1 bonus<br /> Exhausting: each hit has 5% chance to let the wearer fatigued for 5 rounds<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable by:<br /> Kensai<br /> Wizard Slayer|

He was still an active warrior at the age of seventy-five, but the weight of his armor was getting harder and harder to bear. His companion, the sorceress Nadalarin, created these bracers for him. She also cast a permanent illusion over him so that his men would think he still wore his heavy chain. Tapid died twenty years later, his hands wrapped around the neck of an orc chief when old age took him.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *BRAC14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BRAC14.png "Bracers of Defense AC 4") | **Bracers of Defense AC 4**<br /><br />Baron Tiri of the North requisitioned ten of these bracers, one for each of his bodyguards. The Baron thought it amusing when bandits -- thinking them easy targets for they wore no armor -- would attack him and his men as they made excursions across the land. The Guards of Tiri swiftly dealt with the would be attackers. Of course, Baron Tiri himself never wore a set of bracers, and it was this unfortunate oversight that led to his death at the hands of an assassin's poisoned dagger.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Wizard Slayer|

With his skill, charm, and bravado -- no man other than he would joust without armor -- he soon became a favorite to the ladies who watched the events. Too much of a favorite it would seem, for one afternoon he was caught frolicking with a knight's betrothed. A challenge was issued, but in his rush Glen forget to don his bracers. Glen died with a confused grin on his face after the knight's sword struck him, never knowing his own folly.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *BRAC16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BRAC16.png "Bracers of the Blinding Strike") | **Bracers of the Blinding Strike**<br /><br />Ardulia the Agile often said, 'Attack swiftly, and your enemy will be so overwhelmed that the battle will be yours.' He lived this principle through these bracers. Before engaging in battle, he would unlock the magic of the Blinding Strike and quickly rush at his enemy. More often than not his opponent would fall within the first few seconds of battle.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Blinding Strike: doubles movement and attack rate for 3 rounds<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Wizard Slayer|

With Oghma's blessings, Milladolin created magical gloves that steadied their hands and heightened their muscle control. Years later, a young Oghmanyte was caught for thievery - guilty of using the gloves. Word spread, and soon the gloves themselves were stolen away.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Lockpicking: +15% bonus<br /> Pick Pockets: +15% bonus<br /> Set Traps: +15% bonus<br /> Precise Strike: +5% chance to score critical hits<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Usable By:<br /> Thief|

He paid a local archer to fire arrows at him. As the arrows approached, Foik's hands would move of their own accord, either knocking the arrow away or catching it. He earned more than a few pieces of gold for his troubles, and these earnings attracted some shadowy figures to Foik's tent that evening. The next morning Foik was found dead, and the gloves were missing.<br /><br />Note: magically created missiles like Melf's Acid Arrows, Flame Arrows and Melf's Minute Meteors can be deflected; magical projectiles like Lightning Bolts, Fireballs and Magic Missiles cannot.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Off-Hand THAC0: -20 penalty<br /> Deflect Arrows: deflects ranged weapons<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Requires: 15 Dexterity<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Monk<br /> Thief (single class only)|

| *BRAC24*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BRAC24.png "Bard's Gloves") | **Bard's Gloves**<br /><br />Maynard, a young genius of a bard (but with little wisdom to spare), found himself the victim of theft when the magic gloves that enhanced his memory were stolen. Instead of outwitting the rogues, Maynard simply recreated the gloves - over and over again. The finished product was stolen each time, and this eventually evolved into an odd working partnership, though never once did Maynard realize he was in business supplying his wondrous Bard's Gloves.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Wearer can memorize one extra spell of each level from 1st to 4th<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard|

Instead of outwitting the rogues, Maynard simply recreated the gloves - over and over again.

| *BRAC26*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BRAC26.png "Bands of Focus") | **Bands of Focus**<br /><br />Bands of the Master<br />When the last kensai of Kamjin-Doh, the Master of Razors, was slain in the fields of western Kara-Tur, these simple leather bands were ripped from his arms... and his arms ripped from his shoulders... as punishment for his destruction of the Kamjin-Doh. The identities of those who defeated him are not known, but the rumors in Kara Tur were that his slayers were the spirits of three sword saints of Kamjin-Doh, returned from death to end the crimes of the renegade kensai.<br /><br />In the surviving teachings of the Kamjin-Doh of Kara-Tur, it is written that a true weapon master relies not on leather, chain, or plate, but on honing their skills so that they are never struck at all... and this means a weapon master must know their enemy's movements like the movements of their own hand. But such mastery lies in staying focused upon your enemy even in the heat of battle... and these simple leather armbands are intended to do just that. While worn, they exert a slight calming influence on the mind of the sword saint that wields them, heightening the warrior's perceptions and senses, and allowing them to read the movements of their opponents easier. On the rare occasion when an enemy strikes a sword saint, these bands allow the wielder to shrug off pain (which in the teachings of Kamjin-Doh are called "distractions") and keep the pain where it belongs - on one's opponent.<br /><br />If you wear these bands, never forget their purpose, never forget your focus, and never forget the reach of your enemy. Keep these three things in your heart, and they will serve you well in battle.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Physical Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 1<br />Usable By:<br /> True Fighter<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|

He is the only one who can use the Gloves, as no one else quite has the knack of it. Oddly, he seems to be able to actually cast spells while wearing the things. Must be because they got style.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Lockpicking: +20% bonus<br /> Pick Pockets: +20% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 0<br />Usable By:<br /> Jan Jansen|
