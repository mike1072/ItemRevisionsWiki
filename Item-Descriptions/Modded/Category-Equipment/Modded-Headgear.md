| *HELM01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM01.png "Helmet") | **Helmet**<br /><br />This class of open-faced helmet, made of reinforced leather or metal, covers most of the head, save the face and neck. These helmets commonly provide protection for the nose as well.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: none<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM02.png "Helm of Despair") | **Helm of Despair**<br /><br />The evil form of the paladin, the blackguard, is opposite in every way. As the image of the paladin often takes the form of a knight in shining armor, so the blackguard wears the dark plate that blends with the night. Blackguard's helmets are fashioned to increase the intimidating presence of their wearer, and are blessed by evil gods.<br /><br />Note: multiple Bless effects are not cumulative.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: +1 bonus<br /> Blessing: wearer is under the effects of a Bless spell, which raises morale by 1, and grants +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects against critical hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Good-aligned characters<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM03.png "Helm of Glory") | **Helm of Glory**<br /><br />Helm of the Valiant<br />Named for its original owner, Sir Tain the Valiant, this helm saw many great battles in his possession. It was eventually passed on to Sir Tain's squire, who had served him faithfully for almost ten years. Alas, the young man had neither the strength nor the skill to uphold his master's legacy. It is rumored he lost his life in the pursuit of a worthy but ultimately futile cause, and the helm has had many owners since.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: +1 bonus<br /> Blessing: wearer is under the effects of a Bless spell, which raises morale by 1, and grants +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Evil-aligned characters<br /> Mage<br /> Bard<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM04.png "Helm of Defense") | **Helm of Defense**<br /><br />Gift of Peace<br />Prized for its noble origin as much as for its benefits to the wearer, the first of these helms was originally intended to be a simple gift. There was no great crisis at hand, nor dangerous evil to be overthrown; just a wish for a friend to give a gift to another. It could just as easily have been a good book or a bottle of wine, but adventurers are eminently more practical in their gift giving. Subsequently, because of its effectiveness in any situation, countless variants of this helm were created. These helms have seen many great battles since theirs creation, but the simple virtue at theirs core is what has always been remembered.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM05.png "Watcher's Helm") | **Watcher's Helm**<br /><br />It is unclear if these magic headpieces were created by clerics of Helm, god of guardians, or if they acquired their name by a more convenient circumstance. Whatever the case, they are highly prized by guards and sentries. Needless to say, bandits have also taken to wearing them, proving the old proverb that 'what's good for the goose is good for the gander'.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to blindness & deafness<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM06.png "Helm of Charm Protection") | **Helm of Charm Protection**<br /><br />As its name suggests, the Helm of Charm Protection protects its wearer from any magical attempts at emotional manipulation. As a precaution, some high-profile mercenary groups regularly equip their members with such helmets to ensure that they can perform their prescribed duties without external interference.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to charm effects<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM07.png "Helm of Balduran") | **Helm of Balduran**<br /><br />Balduran, a legendary seafaring explorer, was the first native of Faerun to set foot on the lands known as Anchorome, making the trek up to Sossal. He returned full of tales and vast wealth, and put forth a large sum of money to protect his sparsely-settled home harbor town. Then he set sail for Anchorome once more, not to been seen again to this day. His money was well spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.<br /><br />The fabled helm of Balduran has long been rumored to wield powerful protective magic. The exact nature of this magic, however, has not yet been determined.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +5 bonus<br /> Magic Resistance: +5% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|

| *HELM14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM14.png "Kiel's Helmet") | **Kiel's Helmet**<br /><br />This is the helmet worn by Kiel the Legion-Killer, first-born son of Durlag Trollkiller and Clan-prince of his father's ill-fated tower. It is said that anyone who wears it is granted immunity to all forms of fear and panic, be their origins natural or magical.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to fear effects<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|

| *HELM16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM16.png "Helm of Brilliance") | **Helm of Brilliance**<br /><br />This helm appears ordinary until its true nature is perceived. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, the Helm of Brilliance is set with diamonds, rubies, fire opals, and opals, each of large size and enchanted. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels allow the wearer to cast a variety of powerful spells and can absorb significant amounts of fire damage.<br />The few such helms reported to still exist have been traced back to a great cleric of Lathander from Baldur's Gate named Ergelion. Ergelion equipped his companions with these helms to turn back a horde of undead swarming out of the Troll Hills to the north. Though the horde never reached Baldur's Gate, none of that band of adventurers was seen or heard from again.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Fireball<br /> False Dawn<br /> Prismatic Spray<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +40% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM17.png "Skull of Death") | **Skull of Death**<br /><br />The mad necromancer-lich N'Ashtar Nikadeemus forged this helmet from the bones of his own parents. His highest ranked general would wear it when he rode into battle, using it to instantly slay the commanders of the opposing army. After that, the skeletal armies of N'Ashtar would overrun their demoralized enemies. When N'Ashtar finally fell, the Skull of Death was supposedly destroyed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Gaze of Death: target must save vs. death or die<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to death effects<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Paladin<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM21.png "Dragon Helm") | **Dragon Helm**<br /><br />The skillful hand of the warlock Wormsor carefully worked several dragon scales into this powerful helmet. The overlapping red scales protects the wearer from normal blows as well as fire damage, and donning the helmet also grants immunity to magical sleep and unconsciousness, though it is hard to determine whether these benefits originate within the scales or the spells of the mage.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +20% bonus<br /> Immunity to sleep & unconsciousness<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Bard<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM22.png "Helmet") | **Helmet**<br /><br />This class of decorative helmet, made of reinforced leather or metal, covers the face and head. Eye slits and breathing holes come highly recommended. This is the standard helm used by Amnish soldiers.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: None<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *HELM31*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM31.png "Helm of the Rock") | **Helm of the Rock**<br /><br />While most barbarians of the Tuigan tribes go to war wearing fur caps or helms taken from the enemy dead, a few select war leaders wear enchanted helms such as this one. In addition to the protection they provide the Tuigan leaders, the helms are useful for inspiring a sense of fear - not only in the people they seek to conquer, but also in their own warriors.<br /><br />This helm grants a warrior immunities far beyond mere physical protections. It is obvious there once used to be a set of horns protruding from the metal cap, though the horns and any magic associated with them have long since disappeared.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Elemental Resistance: +15% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Usable By:<br /> Fighter|
| *HELM32*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM32.png "Horned Helm of the Rock") | **Horned Helm of the Rock**<br /><br />While most barbarians of the Tuigan tribes go to war wearing fur caps or helms taken from the enemy dead, a few select war leaders wear enchanted helms such as this one. In addition to the protection they provide the Tuigan leaders, the helms are useful for inspiring a sense of fear - not only in the people they seek to conquer, but also in their own warriors.<br /><br />With the addition of the horns, the Helm of the Rock is even more powerful. Generals and military leaders can command both fear and respect simply by wearing this helm.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (three times per day):<br /> Gaze of Despair: target must save vs. spell or be paralyzed by fear for 2 rounds<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Elemental Resistance: +25% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Usable By:<br /> Fighter|
| *HELM33*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HELM33.png "Gold Horned Helm") | **Gold Horned Helm**<br /><br />This class of decorative helmet, made of reinforced leather or metal, covers the face and head. Eye slits and breathing holes come highly recommended. This is the standard helm used by Amnish soldiers.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: None<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *COMPON05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/COMPON05.png "Roranach's Horn") | **Roranach's Horn**<br /><br />Passed down from generation to generation of Rashemi warriors, this helm provides its user with enhanced vitality, and resistance to attacks of physical nature. However the rushing charges encouraged by its user's raging have often led to this helm changing hands perhaps more frequently than it should.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Physical Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
| *WA2HELM*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WA2HELM.png "Shadow Veil") | **Shadow Veil**<br /><br />Made of blackened silver and dark blue steel, this helm is rumored to slowly corrupt its wearer to bend to Shar's whim, so that ultimately the Dark Goddess gains a powerful follower by greatly warding the victim in what her clerics often refer to as the subject's "infancy."<br />The helm is capable of absorbing significant amounts of cold damage, and with a command word, it can create a shadow clone of the wearer to fight alongside him. Those who possess it inevitably become creatures of the night themselves, operating as easily in the dark as they would during the day - and under the watchful eye of Shar.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Simulacrum<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Darkvision<br /> Cold Resistance: +40% bonus<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 1<br />Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Paladin<br /> Thief<br /> Kensai|
