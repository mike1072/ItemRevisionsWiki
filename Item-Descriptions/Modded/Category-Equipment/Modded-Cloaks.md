| *CLCK01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK01.png "Cloak of Protection +1") | **Cloak of Protection +1**<br /><br />Amulets, cloaks and rings of this sort are infused with protective spells, and are among the most popular and numerous magic items on the market. The original design may have originated in the earliest of arcane guilds, but the current makers of these items are varied and widespread. Unfortunately multiple protective enchantments of these kind don't stack, and thus no other amulet, cloak, or ring of protection can be worn while wearing this cloak.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK02.png "Cloak of Protection +2") | **Cloak of Protection +2**<br /><br />The Protector<br />The royal guard of King Pyronan, ruler of Impiltur, were given cloaks such as this as an honorary show of status. Unfortunately, members of the guard had trouble coming to a consensus amongst themselves regarding who should receive such cloak. After years of internal hostility, the mantles were lost and the guards were replaced by less greedy individuals.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK03.png "Cloak of Displacement") | **Cloak of Displacement**<br /><br />Interwoven with strands of sinew from a displacer beast's tentacles, the fabric of a Cloak of Displacement distorts and warps light waves, and once in combat it causes subtle shifts in the image of its wearer, by as much as six inches in any direction, making it much harder for enemies to score a proper hit on the wearer.<br />Aside from being an effective defense in combat situations, it has also been the cause of serious eyestrain amongst fellow party members.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Displacement: opponents suffer -2 penalty to attack rolls when fighting the wearer with melee weapons, -4 with ranged ones<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK04.png "Cloak of the Wolf") | **Cloak of the Wolf**<br /><br />Relair's Mistake<br />A great amount of irony surrounds the creation of this magical cloak. Relair was a mage who overestimated the amount of control he had over magic, and in the course of creating this garment he apparently infected himself with lycanthropy. The wearer can change form whenever he wishes, Relair was not so lucky.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Polymorph (Werewolf)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Regeneration: wearer regenerates 1 hit point every 2 rounds<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK05.png "Cloak of Balduran") | **Cloak of Balduran**<br /><br />Balduran, a legendary seafaring explorer, was the first native of Faerun to set foot on the lands known as Anchorome and made the trek up to Sossal. He returned full of tales and vast wealth, and put forth a large sum of money to protect his sparsely-settled home harbor town. Then he set sail of Anchorome again and has never been seen again. His money was well spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.<br /><br />This cloak was reputedly worn by Balduran, and like most of its equipment it holds powerful enchantments.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK06.png "Cloak of Non-Detection") | **Cloak of Non-Detection**<br /><br />Whispers of Silence<br />Reportedly created for a lineage of the greatest burglars ever to walk the night, this cloak was apparently a success allowing the wearer to became non-detectable by magical means such as Detect Invisibility and True Sight. No record exists of previous owners.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Non-detection<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK07.png "Nymph Cloak") | **Nymph Cloak**<br /><br />Named for the creatures most closely associated with beauty, Nymph Cloaks are popular fodder for tavern tales among the common folk. The story usually involves some hapless noble couple spending a fortune on one or more such items so they can stand to look at one another. It always gets a big laugh among a copper-ale crowd, though most professional bards consider such pandering a tool of the unskilled.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Blinding Beauty: opponents within 20 feet must save vs. spell or be blinded for 1 turn<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus vs. spell<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK08.png "Algernon's Cloak") | **Algernon's Cloak**<br /><br />Algernon's cloak is imbued with magical properties such that the wearer will seem to shine with an inner glow.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: +1 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK20.png "Cloak of the Shield") | **Cloak of the Shield**<br /><br />This cloak projects a shielding field of invisible force that protects the wearer from physical attacks just as though he were wearing armor. This sphere of energy is particularly effective against missile weapons which are slowed somewhat and often end up falling to the ground before reaching the target. The barrier also protects the wearer from the spell Magic Missile.<br /><br />Note: multiple Shield effects are not cumulative.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Protection from Spell: Magic Missile<br /><br />Armor Class: 5 (+2 vs. missile)<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK23.png "Cloak of Elvenkind") | **Cloak of Elvenkind**<br /><br />This green cloak resembles a normal cloak. Wearing it makes any person able to hide in shadows with astonishing skill. Elven rangers and scouts are given cloaks like this one to help hide them while patrolling the borders of their lands. These cloaks vary in effectiveness, depending on the status of the original owner.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Hide In Shadows: +50% bonus<br /> Fade Away: 10% chance to turn invisible when struck by either a spell or a weapon<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK24*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK24.png "Stormlord's Cloak") | **Stormlord's Cloak**<br /><br />Balhoderie the Wrathful was a pirate captain in Nelanther in the mid-1300s DR. Though he was known for his great temper and brutality, he was rather sensitive when it came to physical discomfort from the elements. He was constantly commanding his underlings to add wood to his fires or open windows in his cabin. He was so annoyed by the inability of his crew to constantly maintain a perfect temperature around him that he hunted down a Stormlord of Talos and slew him for his cloak.<br />Though Balhoderie had some of his lady friends sew over the Talosian symbols on the cloak with bits of pirate flags, the brothers of the Stormlord never forgot Balhoderie's blasphemous plunder. By 1360, they had managed to install a youthful Stormlord on one of Balhoderie's three ships, the Sarketa. When the opportunity presented itself, the Stormlord roused the crew to mutiny. After Balhoderie had been overthrown, the Stormlord retrieves the cloak and installed himself as the new commander of the dead pirate's fleet.<br />The Black Cloud Madion terrorized the southern Sword Coast for the next five years before he died in a bloody battle with heavily armed merchant ships just outside the port of Baldur's Gate.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +25% bonus<br /> Cold Resistance: +25% bonus<br /> Electrical Resistance: +25% bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK25*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK25.png "Nature's Vengeance") | **Nature's Vengeance**<br /><br />The Avengers are members of a special sect within a druidic order. They are devoted to fighting those who defile nature, and these cloaks were sometimes worn by members of their sect when embarking on their crusades against those who had inflicted grievous wounds upon the land.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Vengeance: all who strike the wearer have a 20% chance to be struck back by a lightning and suffer 6d6 points of electrical damage<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK26*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK26.png "Cloak of Mirroring") | **Cloak of Mirroring**<br /><br />Though it feels much like normal cloth, this shimmering cloak has on occasion been described as "woven water". Its true enchantment becomes apparent in battle when the mantle makes a reflected image of the wearer to appear alongside him. Unable to discern which one is real, an attacker has a 50% chance that he will attack the image and a 50% chance that he will attack the wearer, in either case risking to trigger again another image. Whenever an attacker successfully hits the wearer the cloak dazzles foes with sparkling lights for an instant and causes another image to appear.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Reflected Image: 50% miss chance<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK27*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK27.png "Cloak of the Sewers") | **Cloak of the Sewers**<br /><br />For a sewer dweller like Ivan, survival meant going where others refused. Hiding from thugs, Ivan went so deep into the sewers beneath Baldur's Gate, that he found caverns of natural caves, some of which opened to the ocean. Within one cave, Ivan discovered what he thought was a ruined cloak, all torn and stained. He tossed it into the fire he started, but it would not burn. Curious, he donned it, and with some prying he discovered its hidden abilities. With the right command he could shift into a rat, or a mustard jelly.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Polymorph Self (Rat)<br /> Polymorph Self (Mustard Jelly)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: -1 penalty<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Immunity to disease effects<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Paladin<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK30*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK30.png "Cloak of Bravery") | **Cloak of Bravery**<br /><br />This cloak is a powerful, evil thing. Made from the poorly stitched together skin of innocent nymphs, and blessed by unholy powers, it bestows on the bearer an almost reckless bravery in battle.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> THAC0: +2 bonus<br /> Immunity to fear effects<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +10 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK31*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK31.png "Improved Cloak of Protection +2") | **Improved Cloak of Protection +2**<br /><br />The Protector<br />The royal guard of King Pyronan, ruler of Impiltur, were given cloaks such as this as an honorary show of status. Unfortunately, members of the guard had trouble coming to a consensus amongst themselves regarding who should receive such cloak. After years of internal hostility, the mantles were lost and the guards were replaced by less greedy individuals.<br /><br />Cespenar infused this cloak with even more powerful protective enchantments.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Mantle<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throw: +2 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *CLCK32*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CLCK32.png "Montolio's Cloak") | **Montolio's Cloak**<br /><br />Montolio Debrouchee, better known as "Mooshie", was a ranger of great renown, having dedicated himself to the defense of all living things not evil in nature, and total dedication to the goddess of the forest, Mielikki, at an early age. He served as a ranger for many years, often as a scout for large armies, or working with small groups of rangers or by himself. Montolio was a good friend and a mentor of the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden. He became blinded five years before he met Drizzt while serving with a ranger group known as the Range Watchers, when they encountered and came into battle against a vicious red dragon, which killed three rangers and melted Montolio's face. His face was healed by clerics, but his eyes were beyond repair. Being pitied even by the Range Watchers and thinking his life meaningless, he fell into despair and came to the grove later known as Mooshie's Grove to die there. Instead, he learned to survive by using his other senses to their fullest extent. He befriended the animals and made it a personal goal to keep watch on, and protect the caravans going near the grove from Graul, an orc leader, and his raiding band. Mooshie eventually died of natural causes in his sleep.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> THAC0: +1 bonus<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /> Blind-Fight: wielder fights without penalties even if unable to see and cannot be backstabbed<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Usable By:<br /> Ranger|
| *DWCLCK01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWCLCK01.png "Drow Piwafwi Cloak") | **Drow Piwafwi Cloak**<br /><br />The magically enhanced drow piwafi cloak is one of the most important accoutrements of a drow's possession. Even the most common of these cloaks carries a most powerful enchantment to protect its wearer. All drow long to own a piwafi; though, only those who have proven themselves useful, or who come from rich, powerful families can afford to own one. Talented drow weavers have woven strands of adamantine into the cloak, thus rendering it useless if exposed to the light -- the effect of which will turn the cloak to dust.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Hide in Shadows: +75% bonus<br /> Move Silent: +75% bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +6 vs. breath<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *NPCLCK*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPCLCK.png "Cloak of the High Forest") | **Cloak of the High Forest**<br /><br />In his younger years, Cernd spent a cycle of seasons meditating on his role within nature. He made no shelter for himself, wanting to be completely unencumbered by the trappings of civilization. Nature may have appreciated his intent, but She also knows that, for all their dedication, at times her children can be foolish. Cernd found this cloak before the cold season set in, seemingly woven from the very undergrowth to fit him perfectly. The message was clear: he can appreciate the rain while still seeking shelter from it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Elemental Resistance: +10% bonus<br /> Regeneration: wearer regenerates 1 hit point every 2 rounds<br /> Protection from Spells: Summon Insects, Insect Plague, and Creeping Doom<br /><br />Weight: 3<br />Usable By:<br /> Cernd|
