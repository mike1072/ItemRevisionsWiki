| *AMUL01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL01.png "Amulet of Health") | **Amulet of Health**<br /><br />When Jacin Maltis, a petty lord in Sembia, paid for the crafting of an amulet to increase his health, he expected a tasteful necklace with a small, but precious gem mounted in it. When he placed the necklace around his neck and the diamond turned a gaudy blood red, he refused to pay the wizard who created it. The wizard simply smiled, and loosed a spell that instantly destroyed the noble. Copies of this amulet were found circulating months later in the distant city of Waterdeep.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +10 bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL14.png "Amulet of Protection +1") | **Amulet of Protection +1**<br /><br />Amulets, cloaks and rings of this sort are infused with protective spells, and are among the most popular and numerous magic items on the market. The original design may have originated in the earliest of arcane guilds, but the current makers of these items are varied and widespread. Unfortunately multiple protective enchantments of these kind don't stack, and thus no other amulet, cloak, or ring of protection can be worn while wearing this amulet.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL15.png "Shield Amulet") | **Shield Amulet**<br /><br />Made by the Harpell clan of wizards in Longsaddle, these simple but elegant amulets generate a large shield-sized invisible wall of force that stays with the wearer and protects him as if it were a normal shield. This special creation can be activated and deactivated at will, and so does not encumber nor does it interfere with arcane spellcasting.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL16.png "Amulet of Metaspell Influence") | **Amulet of Metaspell Influence**<br /><br />The Amplifier<br />Known for its ability to enhance spellcasting, the Amulet of Metaspell Influence is highly sought after by practitioners of magic. It was created by Elairdrin Mellwith who resided in the Star Mountains. His reasons for fabricating such an item stemmed from his womanizing habits, and to this end the Amplifier served his purpose well. It was later taken from him by a wizardress with a more destructive intent, but records detailing the change of hands vary widely.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to silence<br /> Casting Speed: +1 bonus<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *AMUL17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL17.png "Greenstone Amulet") | **Greenstone Amulet**<br /><br />Creatures that attack the mind are the stuff of nightmares, so it is not surprising that items protecting against them might acquire some of their disrepute. Greenstone amulets, for example, have been linked to a claim that when the drow first retreated underground they fed on intellect devourers, and that eating such a creature without wearing a greenstone amulet produced a mind flayer. This is all, of course, nothing more than superstitious tavern talk. Nonetheless these mind shielding amulets are indeed used by drows who have to deal with the illithids, as they call them, being it a peaceful deal, or a not so peaceful one.<br /><br />These highly prized items are fist-sized green stone worked into some kind of smooth shape, usually like a flattened egg, but sometimes like a shield or helmet. When worn, the greenstone protects the wearer from all forms of mind attacks, including psionics.<br /><br />Note: it does not confer complete immunity to psionics.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Mind Shield: confers protection against many forms of mind-affecting magic, such as charm, confusion, domination, fear, feeblemind, hold, sleep, and psionics<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL18.png "Silver Charm") | **Silver Charm**<br /><br />Amulets are necklaces with some form of large decoration or symbol. Most are ornamental, but some such as this one are potent magic items. Lore holds that shapeshifters and some fiends are especially vulnerable to the bite of silver weaponry, and this amulet containing powdered silver seems to protect the wearer from the attacks of those creatures.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Silver Glow: +2 bonus to AC and saving throws vs. werewolves and vampires<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL19.png "Amulet of Magic Shielding") | **Amulet of Magic Shielding**<br /><br />Commissioners working for the Athkatla city council often wear these amulets while searching for spell users. The amulet provides some small protection against devious mages who resist being imprisoned or killed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Energy Resistance: +10% bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL20.png "Kaligun's Amulet of Magic Resistance") | **Kaligun's Amulet of Magic Resistance**<br /><br />This particular amulet has the initials KP on its back surface. KP, or Kaligun Poonil, was the general of a small force sent into the woodlands to clear out Red Wizards. Being particularly fearful of magic, he wore this amulet along with other magical protections. Overconfident in these protections, Kaligun finally died when he foolishly ambushed three high level Red Wizards who lowered his magic resistance before destroying him with their spells.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Magic Resistance (15th caster level)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL21.png "Amulet of Power") | **Amulet of Power**<br /><br />Arduelth, a young witch, had spent her life living under the shadow of Thay, and wished to study for a magical means to empower Rashemen, so she left on a dajemma - the customary Rashemi journey of self-discovery. Years later she returned, a haunted look in her eyes. Around her neck she wore an amulet that glowed with power - only the first of the artifacts she claimed to have learned how to create. She spoke long and passionately of how they could make use of such items - to not only bring peace to Rashemen, but break the back of Thay. The hathrans narrowed their eyes behind their masks as she spoke, fearing the young woman's intensity: but they listened, and gravely made her one of them.<br /><br />Before long, the witches began to regret their decision. The young woman seemed obsessed with the idea of creating more items of greater and more sinister properties... and her plans grew more and more elaborate, from freeing the slaves of Thay to enslaving the Red Wizards in their place, sapping them of their power for her own devices. It was suspected that Arduelth had become a durthan, eternal enemy of the hathrans - but another witch saw once that she communed with something far darker. Though the young woman still dreamed of peace and freedom for her people, she had given herself over to a dark entity - her pure intentions savaged by the lengths she would dare go to achieve them.<br /><br />Though it seems Arduelth's life has come to an end, the amulet still glows with a same promising light...<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Caster Level: +2 bonus<br /> Arcane and divine casters can memorize one extra spell of each level from 1st to 4th<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *AMUL22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL22.png "Periapt of Proof Against Poison") | **Periapt of Proof Against Poison**<br /><br />This periapt, which has to be be worn next to the skin, makes the wearer immune to all poisons. Items with similar functions are in common circulation, created for nobles or merchants fearing poison. Eunuchs from Kara-Tur wear amulets such as this when sampling their emperor's food, and The Purple Dragons use rings with similar powers to protect the Obarskyr royal family from assassination attempts.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to poison effects<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL23.png "Periapt of Life Protection") | **Periapt of Life Protection**<br /><br />Natnea Chesh was one of the first priestesses of Kelemvor in the Moonshae Islands, and became known as "The Defender of the Dead", when she helped stop a necromancer from raising an army of undead. As a gift for her heroic deeds, Kelemvor gave her this amulet, along with the secret of making copies for other clerics dedicated to the destruction of powerful undead creatures.<br />A heart-sized sapphire sits at the end of a thin silver wire. When worn, this periapt radiates life energy, infusing the wearer with power. The inscription on the back reads: 'Against Death we must all fail, but with this gem we may still prevail!'<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to death & level drain effects<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL24*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL24.png "Necklace of Form Stability") | **Necklace of Form Stability**<br /><br />Dydaar'a of the Altered was a witch of great temper who rewarded the slightest insult with harsh punishment. Often the offender would spend several weeks transformed into some form of wild beast or a statue for her garden, a practice which of course earned her many enemies. It is recorded that she once fought a mage named Maxell who had previously suffered such a fate. For his return he had prepared this necklace, designed to protect him from her most powerful alteration spells, but he could not shield those around him as well. Apparently an impromptu army of farmers-turned-bears eventually overwhelmed him.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to disintegration, petrification & polymorph effects<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL25*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL25.png "Amulet of Spell Warding") | **Amulet of Spell Warding**<br /><br />A favorite item of protection for a mage entering a magical duel, this amulet provides protection against spells, but does not interfere with the mage's own spellcasting. These potent defensive amulets are much in demand in areas where duels between rival spellcasters are common. Armed with one of these items, even a relatively inexperienced caster can withstand the attack of an archmage - albeit briefly.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Spell Deflection<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *AMUL26*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL26.png "Amulet of Cheetah Speed") | **Amulet of Cheetah Speed**<br /><br />Shamans of many barbarian clans have long looked upon the cheetah as one of the most nimble and swift hunters. Warriors of these clans rely on agility and quick movements instead of pure strength and they get across the battlefield like a whirlwind. Barbarian shamans would sometimes create spells that would temporarily imbue the warriors with inhuman quickness and fleetness of foot. However, since these spells were temporary, often times the spell would wear off at inopportune times.<br /><br />Thus a group of barbarian shamans once congregated to find a way to better harness the swift agility of the cheetah. For nearly a year the shamans remained out of sight from their home clans, busily focusing their attentions towards the magic to create such items. Then one day, the shamans returned to their respective clans, each holding a small necklace, with a pendant that resembled a cheetah's paw. The shamans gave this pendant to their strongest warrior of each clan. Once placed around the neck of the warrior, the speed of the cheetah filled their powerful bodies. From then on, the Amulet of Cheetah Speed, as it became known, would become one of the most prized artifacts within barbarian clans. Only the mightiest warriors wore the amulet, and it became the goal of all young warriors to one day be adorned with an amulet such as this.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Improved Haste<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Dexterity: +1 bonus<br /> Attack Speed: +2 bonus<br /> Movement Rate: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus vs. breath<br /><br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk<br /> Wizard Slayer|

| *AMUL28*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AMUL28.png "Amulet of the Master Harper") | **Amulet of the Master Harper**<br /><br />Ciressa Gind'ra was a cunning arcane trickster who infiltrated the Night Masks for the Harpers, before she was found drowned in a two-inch puddle outside her residence. To infiltrate them, Ciressa created an amulet that allowed her to boost her abilities to that of a master thief. One night she used it to break into the Night King's private quarters. Unfortunately, she didn't anticipate the Night King's Faithful Hound, who was summoned to guard the room. The phantom watchdog immediately commenced a loud barking, revealing her presence to the Night King himself. When he was finished with her, he took the amulet, and since it had qualities useful for many adventurers, he made copies of it, which he sold throughout the land.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Lore: +10 bonus<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Find Traps: +20% bonus<br /> Lockpicking: +20% bonus<br /> Detect Illusions: +20% bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus vs. spell<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Thief|
| *MISC5X*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/MISC5X.png "Amulet of Harper Pin") | **Amulet of Harper Pin**<br /><br />A Harper Pin is a treasured item, signifying that the bearer is an honored and trusted member of the Harpers. It grants the wearer exceptional protection against many different kinds of attacks. They are not attuned to any particular person, but you would be hard pressed to find someone that would lend such an item or even let it out of their sight. It is quite literally a badge of honor.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Non-Detection<br /> Electrical Resistance: +100% bonus<br /> Protection from Spell: Magic Missile<br /> Saving Throws: +5 bonus vs. spells<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Harper|
