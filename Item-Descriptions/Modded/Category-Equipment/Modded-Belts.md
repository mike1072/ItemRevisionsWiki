| *BELT04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BELT04.png "Girdle of Piercing") | **Girdle of Piercing**<br /><br />The life of a swashbuckler is full of bravery, grand adventure, and epic fencing duels.

| *BELT05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BELT05.png "Girdle of Gender") | **Girdle of Gender**<br /><br />The cursed girdle of gender, a rare yet oft-discussed magical item, is wrought with a most powerful magic. Anyone unfortunate enough to secure it around their waist instantly finds their gender to be transformed. It is said that, not fifty years past, a nameless court jester was beheaded for presenting the girdle as a gift to Duke Lobelahn's lover<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer.|
| *BELT06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BELT06.png "Girdle of Beatification") | **Girdle of Beatification**<br /><br />Priests of the Red Knight in the Citadel of Strategic Militancy, just north of Baldur's Gate, consecrated this belt and gave it to the warrior Thom Wainwright, who had performed a number of great services for the Order of the Red Falcons. Thom wore the girdle proudly until he fell into severe debt in his later years. To his undying regret, he auctioned it off to a well-known priest of Tempus.<br /><br />Note: multiple Bless effects are not cumulative.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Blessing: wearer is under the effects of a Bless spell, which raises morale by 1, and grants +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls<br /> Wearer is unaffected by Doom and the negative effects of Chant or similar spells<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *BELT07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BELT07.png "Girdle of Priestly Might") | **Girdle of Priestly Might**<br /><br />These items first appeared after the Time of Troubles, and Priests of Mystra took it to be a sign that the goddess had regained her power. It is not known exactly how many other girdles of this type have appeared in the Realms. Given the new, more active stance that powers have been forced to take in the Realms, it is thought that there may be more than a few of these items, and that many deities may have granted such girdles to their more devoted and powerful followers.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Strength: +2 bonus<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|

However, en route to their den the kobolds surprised a family of stone giants. These giants rescued Stewart and raised him as their own. It soon became apparent that the boy, no matter how hard he tried, could not compete in the family rock throwing contests. The stone giant father bartered with a local wizard for this girdle, which made Stewart as strong as his brothers and sisters. When Stewart met an untimely end, the girdle was stolen away.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Strength: +3 bonus<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *BELT09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BELT09.png "Girdle of Trollish Fortitude") | **Girdle of Trollish Fortitude**<br /><br />This girdle greatly increases the wearer's constitution. King Violos used it when leading an expedition against marsh trolls. He'd been severely sickened the previous winter and was no longer the healthy man he once was.

The barrier is not strong enough to keep enemies out, but it can slow them a bit. By the scorch marks on the worn leather, it is obvious that this belt has been worn at least once against a dragon.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Saving Throws: +3 bonus vs. breath<br /> Missile Damage Resistance: +20% bonus<br /> Inertial Barrier: opponents within 10 feet suffer -1 penalty to weapon speed factor, damage and attack rolls<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *BELT11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BELT11.png "Girdle of the Champion") | **Girdle of the Champion**<br /><br />Graena's Triumph<br />The famous barbarian explorer Graena was a member of the Sky Pony tribe of the Uthgardt northerners. When she tried to leave the tribe to seek her fortune in southern lands, the elders of the tribe told her she could not leave. At that time, only men were allowed to leave the tribe. The elders believed women were too valuable to let go. In order to prove herself to the elders, Graena had to run a gauntlet of the strongest warriors in the tribe and wrest the belt of the head warrior from his body. Graena underwent the challenge and emerged bloody and broken, but victorious. According to tribal law, she was now the head warrior of the tribe and effectively male. The elders knew she was going to leave, but they gave her a warrior's name, Graena Blood-Has-Dried. She left the tribe, relinquished her position to the old head warrior, and returned his belt to him. But before she left, she swore to never harm a member of the tribe if she encountered one in the future.<br /><br />Years later, she looked back on that fateful day and felt pride in the fact that she had beaten the greatest men of her tribe. She had a girdle constructed that looked identical to the one she had won. Not content to stop there, she had a priest of Tempus bless it with a powerful enchantment. Graena was wearing her belt when she died fighting a group of fire giants near the Marching Mountains.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Strength: +3 bonus<br /> Immunity to fear effects<br /><br />Weight: 1<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
