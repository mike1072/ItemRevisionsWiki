| *SW1H01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H01.png "Bastard Sword") | **Bastard Sword**<br /><br />Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. The bastard sword has a double-edged blade and a long grip, which can accommodate both hands if preferred. The overall length of the bastard sword ranges between four feet and four feet ten inches.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 2D4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H02.png "Bastard Sword +1") | **Bastard Sword +1**<br /><br />Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. The bastard sword has a double-edged blade and a long grip, which can accommodate both hands if preferred. The overall length of the bastard sword ranges between four feet and four feet ten inches. This bastard sword is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H03.png "Lawgiver +2") | **Lawgiver +2**<br /><br />The bane of the chaotic or morally suspect, a Lawgiver blade has but one purpose: to enforce the rule of law wherever that authority is challenged or questioned. Whether or not the concept of "law" coincides with the concept of "justice" is largely irrelevant, as the owners of these weapons often view the world in a very polarized fashion. There is right and there is wrong, and other details only serve to confuse the matter.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to confusion effects<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Axiomatic: inflicts additional damage depending on target's alignment<br /> +0 vs. lawful<br /> +2 vs. neutral<br /> +4 vs. chaotic<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Chaotic-aligned characters<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H18.png "Sword of Balduran +2") | **Sword of Balduran +2**<br /><br />Balduran, a legendary seafaring explorer, was the first native of Faerûn to set foot on the lands known as Anchorome and made the trek up to Sossal. He returned full of tales and vast wealth, and put forth a large sum of money to protect his sparsely-settled home harbor town. Then he set sail of Anchorome again and has never been seen again. His money was well spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.<br /><br />This ornate but poorly balanced weapon was found beside Balduran's remains, and like most of his equipment, it holds powerful enchantments.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Silver Blade: inflicts 4 additional points of damage against lycanthropes and vampires<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H34*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H34.png "Albruin +1") | **Albruin +1**<br /><br />Albruin was held for decades in the royal house of Cormyr, kept as a family treasure and often borne by the kings of that land due to its defensive abilities which foiled many assassination attempts. It was stolen from the palace at Suzail in the Year of Daystar (1286 DR) by the thief Nypan, a halfling who was soon arrested in Wheloon by soldiers of Cormyr and slain when he attempted to escape. Unfortunately, Nipe did not have the blade when sized, and he did not reveal its whereabouts.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to poison effects<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Luminous: target must save vs. spell or be outlined by a pale glowing light for 4 rounds, suffering -2 penalty to AC and being unable to hide<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H37*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H37.png "Taragarth +2") | **Taragarth +2**<br /><br />The Bloodbrand<br />Taragarth is believed to have been forged by Elfgar of Silverymoon in the early days of the North and was given to the champion Aeroth when he led the armies of the kingdoms of the North against the trolls of the Evermoors. The might of the trolls was broken at the Long Battle (nine days' duration) across the moors, and the bloody Taragarth brandished aloft so often by the valiant Aeroth that it was dubbed The Bloodbrand.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Acidic: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of acid damage<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H38*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H38.png "Jhor The Bleeder +2") | **Jhor The Bleeder +2**<br /><br />This blade belonged to Ho Mang, a traveler from Kara-Tur who accepted dubious service at court throughout Faerun. Skilled in "persuasion," he would use this sword to perform the "Death Of A Thousand Cuts," an ancient ritual from his homeland involving a lengthy series of small, painful incisions. The properties of the blade prevent blood from clotting, and his victims would slowly bleed to death. The sword was stolen, and its whereabouts have been a mystery until now.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Wounding: target suffer 1 point of bleeding damage every round for 1 turn<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H39*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H39.png "Blade of Searing +3") | **Blade of Searing +3**<br /><br />The benefits enchanted into this sword are plain to see: it is exceptionally accurate, and a lick of flame follows every blow, searing the target in addition to the normal damage received. It is an efficient troll-killer, though it has not yet been heralded as such in song or legend.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Burning Wounds: target must save vs. death or suffer -2 penalty to attack rolls and 1 point of fire damage each round for 3 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H42*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H42.png "Bastard Sword +2") | **Bastard Sword +2**<br /><br />Not only has a smith fashioned this sword such that it is better balanced and more durable than a standard blade, but powerful enchantments have also been placed on it. It is faster, more accurate, and hits for far more damage than a standard sword of its type.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H62*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H62.png "Foebane +4") | **Foebane +4**<br /><br />The Archmage Demron crafted this magical bastard sword for the Elven hero Fflar, Captain of Myth Drannor. The most powerful of six such enchanted blades Demron fashioned, Foebane can drain the very essence of life from its opponents with every blow, and bestow that life energy on the wielder. There are those who believe soul stealing capability has cursed the blade, for though fashioned as a weapon of right and justice, Foebane's dark history is one of murder and death.<br />Demron's own blood christened the blade, as a would be thief used the newly fashioned sword to bring about the Archmage's untimely death, though the thief did not survive the encounter, either. In the aftermath of Demron's murder, Foebane was recovered and presented to the hero Fflar to use in the defense of Myth Drannor, greatest of the Elven cities.<br />Yet even the power of Foebane was not enough to withstand the dark hordes which overran Myth Drannor. When the elven city fell, Captain Fflar met a grisly, gruesome end and the sword itself was lost beneath the rubble of the once great metropolis.<br /><br />Legend holds that Foebane's considerable powers are further augmented when the sword is reunited with the enchanted holy Scabbard of Fflar, its original owner.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Saving Throws: +1 bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Foe Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and damage against undead, shapeshifters, and all extra-planar beings<br /> Vampiric: drains 1D4 hit points from the target and transfers it to the wielder<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H63*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H63.png "Foebane +5") | **Foebane +5**<br /><br />The Archmage Demron crafted this magical bastard sword for the Elven hero Fflar, Captain of Myth Drannor. The most powerful of six such enchanted blades Demron fashioned, Foebane can drain the very essence of life from its opponents with every blow, and bestow that life energy on the wielder. There are those who believe soul stealing capability has cursed the blade, for though fashioned as a weapon of right and justice, Foebane's dark history is one of murder and death.<br />Demron's own blood christened the blade, as a would be thief used the newly fashioned sword to bring about the Archmage's untimely death, though the thief did not survive the encounter, either.

When the elven city fell, Captain Fflar met a grisly, gruesome end and the sword itself was lost beneath the rubble of the once great metropolis.<br /><br />Reunited with Fflar's Holy Scabbard, Foebane is an even greater weapon than the legends claimed.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +5 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Holy: deals 6 additional points of damage against all of evil alignment<br /> Foe Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and damage against undead, shapeshifters, and all extra-planar beings<br /> Vampiric: drains 1D4 hit points from the target and transfers it to the wielder<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H64*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H64.png "Purifier +3") | **Purifier +3**<br /><br />This single-handed weapon is infused with the very essence of virtue, and is rumored to be the sanctified blade of the famous paladin Sir Wediyer. The weapon was lost when Sir Wediyer pursued a fleeing pit fiend through a planar rift. Neither the fiend nor Sir Wediyer ever returned.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Holy: deals 3 additional points of damage against all of evil alignment<br /> Cleansing: 15% chance evil creatures struck by this weapon must save vs. spell at -4 or suffer various effects depending on their level<br /><br />Target's Hit Dice - Effects of Cleansing<br />15 or more - Deafened<br /><15 - Blinded, and deafened<br /><10 - Paralyzed, blinded, and deafened<br /><5 - Killed<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Paladins|

The weapon was lost when Sir Wediyer pursued a fleeing pit fiend through a planar rift. Neither the fiend nor Sir Wediyer ever returned.<br /><br />With the Eye of Tyr set into its pommel, Purifier is perhaps the greatest single instrument of holy justice on the face of Faerun.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities:<br /> Draw Upon Holy Might (twice per day)<br /> Greater Restoration (once per day)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +15% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Holy: deals 6 additional points of damage against all of evil alignment<br /> Cleansing: 15% chance evil creatures struck by this weapon must save vs. spell at -4 or suffer various effects depending on their level<br /><br />Target's Hit Dice - Effects of Cleansing<br />20 or more - Deafened<br /><20 - Blinded, and deafened<br /><15 - Paralyzed, blinded, and deafened<br /><10 - Killed<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Paladins|
