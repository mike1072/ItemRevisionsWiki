| *SW1H46*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H46.png "Wakizashi") | **Wakizashi**<br /><br />The wakizashi, or companion sword, is extremely important to samurai. It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night. As finely made as the katana, the wakizashi is a shorter sword with a length between 12 and 24 inches, and is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H47*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H47.png "Wakizashi +1") | **Wakizashi +1**<br /><br />The wakizashi, or companion sword, is extremely important to samurai. It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night. As finely made as the katana, the wakizashi is a shorter sword with a length between 12 and 24 inches, and is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user. Wu Jen masters have concealed within this wakizashi great power, unleashed only when the wielder is in the thick of battle. How or why this wakizashi made it to Faerun is unknown, but if the samurai who owned it still lives, he will certainly be looking for it.<br /><br />STATISTICS<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H66*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H66.png "Yamato +3") | **Yamato +3**<br /><br />The name of the mighty Wu Jen who fashioned this "companion sword" is long forgotten. However, the name Yamato, loosely translated, means "Guardian" or "Defender."<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Counterattack: all who strike the wearer in melee suffer 1d8+3 points of slashing damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *WAWAK*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAWAK.png "Malakar's Companion +2") | **Malakar's Companion +2**<br /><br />Malakar's Companion belonged to the renowed swordsman Viromoto, a weapon master from the East who fought a hundred duels before finally dying. The keen blade shatters through any opponents's defenses and, as if of its own volition, it will swoop down and deflect the incoming attacks of other weapons. This blade is perfect for the warrior concerned about defense as well as offense but it is so sharp and light that it is difficult for even a master to wield. Viromoto gradually became overconfident and for his final duel he favored a different weapon -- only to fall in battle, his first and only defeat.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Parrying: +1 bonus (none vs. missile)<br /> Keen: +5% chance to score critical hits<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D8 + 2<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight:  2<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength, 17 Dexterity<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
