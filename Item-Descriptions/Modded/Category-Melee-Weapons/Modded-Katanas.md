| *NPSW02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPSW02.png "Yoshimo's Katana +2") | **Yoshimo's Katana +2**<br /><br />This blade, although only lightly enchanted, has achieved a semblance of awareness, enough so that it allows only the thief known as Yoshimo to wield it. Any other than he cannot use this flawless katana in battle.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Toxin: creatures struck must save vs. poison or suffer 2 points of nonlethal damage every 2 seconds for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Yoshimo|
| *NPSW04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPSW04.png "Corthala Family Blade +2") | **Corthala Family Blade +2**<br /><br />This fine katana radiates magical energy when wielded by Valygar. The blade was designed to respond only to those with the blood of the family Corthala flowing through their veins.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Saving Throws: +3 bonus vs. spell<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Spell Disruption: each hit causes +10% cumulative chance of spell failure (1 turn)<br /><br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Valygar|
| *SW1H43*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H43.png "Katana") | **Katana**<br /><br />The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword which ends in a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation both complex and secret, and more an art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is rare. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D10<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H44*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H44.png "Katana +1") | **Katana +1**<br /><br />It is no simple deed to enchant a katana. Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword. Improving it further usually requires a sacrifice; perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into his sword. The wielder of an enchanted katana such as this one must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried the blade into battle. Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H45*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H45.png "Malakar +2") | **Malakar +2**<br /><br />Malakar, or 'Dueling Steel', is a finely craft katana belonged to the renowed swordsman Viromoto, a weapon master from the East who fought a hundred duels before finally dying. The keen blade shatters through any opponents's defenses and, as if of its own volition, it will swoop down and deflect the incoming attacks of other weapons. This radiant katana is perfect for the warrior concerned about defense as well as offense but it is so sharp and light that it is difficult for even a master to wield. Viromoto gradually became overconfident and for his final duel he favored a different weapon -- only to fall in battle, his first and only defeat.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Parrying: +1 bonus (none vs. missile)<br /> Keen: +5% chance to score critical hits<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength, 16 Dexterity<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H51*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H51.png "Celestial Fury +3") | **Celestial Fury +3**<br /><br />Many years ago, fierce tempests and fires ignited by lightning ravished the province administered by daimyo Hoshi Katahiroi. The daimyo's advisers, all respected shukenjas, soon divined that Nature was not to blame, but a powerful dragon of an unknown order. Some of the wise men suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed that it was born of Primal Chaos before Kara-Tur was formed. All the advisers agreed to name it Celestial Fury.<br />Yet daimyo Hoshi did not want to categorize the scourge of his province; he wanted to destroy it. He commissioned the famed Chigatta (a reclusive artisan, master of mystic arts), to construct a weapon that might sunder the dragon's spirit as well as cleave its scaled body. Chigatta's labors resulted in the finest katana imaginable, dubbed Celestial Fury after the beast it was fashioned to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.<br />With this weapon, Hoshi sought his province's bane among the storm clouds. Shouts and roars resounded through the heavens for days, and forked fire lit up the nights. At long last, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within his sword, merging the two Celestial Furies and impressing order over chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi had Chigatta fashion a scabbard from the dragon's hide and embed its magic pearl in the hilt.<br />Yet the dragon had its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. Celestial Fury's spirit took control of Hoshi, forcing him to slay Chigatta and then slay himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely, Hoshi's grieving family discarded the traitorous weapon) and has perhaps changed many hands in the years since.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities:<br /> Batto (at will): when Celestial Fury is drawn, thunder and lightning explode from the scabbard, blinding (3 rounds) and deafening (6 rounds) opponents within 10 feet; those who successfully save vs. wand cannot be affected by this ability for the duration of the encounter<br /> Lightning Bolt (once per day): an arc of lightning leaps at one target inflicting 10D6 points of damage (save vs. breath half)<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Booming Thunder: every successful strike causes a boom that stuns opponents for 1 round (save vs. spell neg.)<br /> Shocking Blow: 5% chance of dealing 20 additional points of electrical damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|

| *SW1H70*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H70.png "Hindo's Doom +3") | **Hindo's Doom +3**<br /><br />Hindo was a ronin of great renown, a staunch defender of his people against the evil overlords who killed his master and ravaged his homelands.<br />"...in the night there came the rain of fire, which crashed as though an avalanche of stone. There were craters in the square, and inside were the stars, from which we forged our vengeance and took back the land of our fathers." The writings of Kaa Mihnd, explaining how a poor fishing village could possess the weapon to challenge their wealthy overlord. The account has never been verified, though this blade is the supposed outcome, as well as Hindo's deeds which have passed into legend.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Lesser Restoration<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Tenchu: 10% chance of casting Holy Smite upon the target (5th caster level)<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H71*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H71.png "Hindo's Doom +4") | **Hindo's Doom +4**<br /><br />Hindo was a ronin of great renown, a staunch defender of his people against the evil overlords who killed his master and ravaged his homelands.<br />"...in the night there came the rain of fire, which crashed as though an avalanche of stone.

The writings of Kaa Mihnd, explaining how a poor fishing village could possess the weapon to challenge their wealthy overlord. The account has never been verified, though this blade is the supposed outcome, as well as Hindo's deeds which have passed into legend.<br /><br />Reunited with the hand of its original owner, Hindo's Doom is a katana worthy of the greatest of Samurai.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Greater Restoration<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to death effects<br /> Magic Resistance: +15% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Tenchu: 15% chance of casting Holy Smite upon the target (5th caster level)<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|

| *WA2DAK*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WA2DAK.png "Dak'kon's Zerth Blade +2") | **Dak'kon's Zerth Blade +2**<br /><br />This sword was the weapon of choice of the famous githzerai Dak'kon who was killed by a powerful entity while working for a creature known as the Nameless One. Perhaps the strange circumstances of his death preserved this blade, as it would otherwise have lost its form when his will no longer shaped it.<br />On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter.<br />A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance and through mental discipline alone, the wielder must maintain the integrity of the blade. He can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the edge and to a lesser extent, its magical properties. Presumably more powerful and experienced minds may be able to manipulate the blade in new ways.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br />  Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Spell Stealer: arcane casters hit by this weapon must save vs. spell or lose one memorized spell, while the wielder gets back into memory a spell that has been previously cast<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Katana/Wakizashi<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Usable by:<br /> Bard<br /> Fighter/Mage<br /> Fighter/Mage/Thief<br /> Mage/Thief|
