| *DWSW1H02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWSW1H02.png "Drowcraft Long Sword +3") | **Drowcraft Long Sword +3**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft weapon is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wielder exceptional accuracy. Drowcraft weapons will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: +2 luck bonus to minimum damage and attack rolls<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *MISCBC*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/MISCBC.png "Blackrazor +3") | **Blackrazor +3**<br /><br />This sword radiates evil like a sour odor, and the owner never knows if he wields the weapon, or if it wields him. Its special purpose is to steal life essences, and when the sword manages to drain a victim's essences it temporarily grants them to the wielder. In addition to its combat abilities, Blackrazor slowly regenerates its owner with the drained strength of opponents.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Regeneration: 1 hp/round<br /> Immunity to charm and fear effects<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Souldrinking: 15% chance to drain one level from the target, raising wielder's maximum hit points by 5, increasing his strength by 1, and hasting him for 1 turn<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H04.png "Long Sword") | **Long Sword**<br /><br />These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 to 47 inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D8<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H05.png "Long Sword +1") | **Long Sword +1**<br /><br />These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 to 47 inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting. This long sword is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H06.png "Varscona +2") | **Varscona +2**<br /><br />Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies. Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified, and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power. In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form. Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few who knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity. Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts. Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated, she became one with the very blade of her weapon. Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own. It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Icy: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of cold damage<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H13.png "Moonblade +3") | **Moonblade +3**<br /><br />This potent weapon was created by the smiths of ancient Myth Drannor.  Moonblades are used in the long process of selecting a ruler for the isle of Evermeet. A Moonblade chooses its owner, and in the case of this sword it has chosen the elf, Xan. Only Xan can use this blade, anyone else who tries will find themselves unable to lift the sword.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Xan wields the moonblade as if it was a long sword but he suffers no penalty for non-proficiency<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Fire Resistance: +40% bonus<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Xan|
| *SW1H19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H19.png "The Vampire's Revenge +3") | **The Vampire's Revenge +3**<br /><br />It would seem that the very speculation of this weapon's existence has conspired to pull it from the realm of fantasy and into the everyday, though, as with all things that come from dreams, it is not as it truly seems. The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; but not only in the manner the finder might have hoped. This semi-sentient blade performs as one might think a vampiric blade would, but it was crafted by vampires for their exclusive use, and any living being wielding it will slowly bleed to death in order to feed its unending thirst for blood. Were this not enough, the weapon's will is loyal only to vampires, and it curses anyone else so as to prevent it's removal.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Bloodsucking: any living wielder loses 1 hit point every 3 rounds<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Vampiric: drains one to four hit points from the target and transfers it to the wielder<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H24*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H24.png "Flame Tongue +3") | **Flame Tongue +3**<br /><br />Blades of this type hail from the workshop of Raegik Hammerhold, a Rashemar smith who refused to reveal the secrets of his craft to any but his chosen apprentice. It is unknown how many of Flame Tongue blades may exist, but it is certain there are no more being produced. Raegik discovered his student dealing with the Red Wizards of Thay, and is believed to have died in the ensuing battle.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Flame Tongue: +2 bonus to THAC0 and damage against regenerating creatures, cold creatures & undead<br /> Flaming: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of fire damage<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H31*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H31.png "Daystar +4") | **Daystar +4**<br /><br />Whether it was created specifically for use in the service of Torm, or appropriated at some point in the long history of the church, Paladins of the Loyal Fury have made good use of Daystar in their battles against evil undead. Through magic or blessing it is empowered with the Sunray, a force of pure life energy so potent that it slays both living and unliving.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Sunray (15th caster level)<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Righteous: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and damage against evil creatures<br /> Sunblade: inflicts 6 additional points of damage against undead creatures<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H32*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H32.png "Dragonslayer +3") | **Dragonslayer +3**<br /><br />Everyone knows the story: a blade, a dragon, a titanic struggle, and a virtuous knight saving hundreds if not thousands of lives. Everyone knows a version of this tale, but could one sword have traveled the world so completely? Perhaps there have been many, perhaps only a few, but it is likely that weapons such as this have become so "well known" in legend that their true histories are forgotten.<br />Few dare to create items such as this, for who does not fear the wrath of dragons, and what action would more draw their ire? Yet, at a time lost in Faerun's past, there was a need, and this sword was forged in answer.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to fear effects<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dragon Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +6 to damage against dragons<br /> Slicing Blow: 15% chance of dealing 20 additional points of slashing damage<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H33*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H33.png "Ras +2") | **Ras +2**<br /><br />The Dancing Blade<br />Beroalf was a barbarian who traveled from the cold north in search of adventure. He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village. Unfortunately, his coarse remarks and rudimentary hygiene repelled most travelers he met, until he expressed his thoughts to a sympathetic mage. The mage, for a price, constructed Ras, the dancing blade. Though not quite what Beroalf had in mind, he was thrilled nonetheless, and wielded the sword for many years. How they were ultimately separated is not known.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Dancing: the sword can attack on its own for 10 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H35*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H35.png "Adjatha the Drinker +2") | **Adjatha the Drinker +2**<br /><br />The Drinker is first known to have existed more than 400 years ago, in the reign of Kurskos Ironhand; it was the sword of that monarch's herald and chief counselor, Amrok of the Dwarves. Kurskos slew Amrok in a night of revelry after a Shieldmeet, and took Adjatha the Drinker (and the enminity of the dwarves) as his own. Amrok was of almost human stature, and it has often been said Adjatha is of human and not dwarven manufacture, for it is of the full size and heft for a strong long-armed human swordsman.<br />The blade was stolen from the palace vaults in the sack of Aumreayum on the death of Kurskos, and since then The Drinker has changed hands often over the years, usually remaining with any one owner for only a short time. Elminster saw Adjatha 40 winters ago at the court of Nesker of Mulmaster, when the sorcerer-king was studying it to increase his own arts. It disappeared before Nesker's death and came to light briefly in reports of fighting in the Shaar, apparently being wielded by one of the nomad chieftains. The sword was stolen from him, and despite sending agents far afield, he was unable to recover it. Its whereabouts were unknown...but some suggested that the blade could have left the Prime Material Plane.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Hit Points: +5 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus vs. spell<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Spell Drinker: arcane casters hit by The Drinker must save vs. spell or lose one memorized spell, raising wielder's maximum hit points by 2 for 1 hour<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H36*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H36.png "Namarra +2") | **Namarra +2**<br /><br />The Sword that Never Sleeps<br />On one side of the blade is etched in Common "Namarra", and on the other face "Never Sleep". Namarra appears in many legends and tall tales, but the designation the "Neversleep Sword" appears to be derived only from the inscription on the blade and does not refer to any specific property of the sword. Its origin is unknown; Namarra appears to have existed for long as tales have survived, wielded by such mythic heroes as Eth and Brensyl the Tall. Even the most critical of sages (Kurmur the Skeptic, First Speaker of Evernoster) cannot determine Namarra's probable time of origin or find any references in the tales of a word to a time "before Namarra was forged".<br />This ancient blade is thought to have been present at some of the most influential conflicts in Faerun's history. Sightings have been noted as far north as Thay and as far south as the jungles of Chult, though documentation is oddly lacking regarding the details. This is perhaps a result of the sword's ability to silence all sound within a large radius, removing the effectiveness of attacking mages, but also preventing any discussion that might have followed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Wall of Silence: wielder is immune to sound-based spells or attacks such as Command, (Un)Holy Word, Power Word, Wail of the Banshee and similar effects<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Silencing: target and opponents within 15 feet must save vs. spell or be silenced for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H40*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H40.png "Blade of Roses +1") | **Blade of Roses +1**<br /><br />This blade possesses an unearthly splendor, and it is likely that Sune, the goddess of beauty and passion, had a hand in its creation. The effect it has on the wielder is immediate, and more than once in its history this sword has been the secret behind a lackluster bard's sudden elevation at court. When drawn, the blade sings loudly and constantly.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: +1 bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Singing Sword: allies within 20 feet gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and +1 bonus to saves vs. spell<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H41*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H41.png "Long Sword +2") | **Long Sword +2**<br /><br />A sword of standardized enchantment, powerful though it is. The great southern nations are said to have once had legions of their soldiers armed in such a fashion, a force that must have appeared truly imposing on the battlefield. The days of such extravagance are long past though.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H54*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H54.png "The Equalizer +4") | **The Equalizer +4**<br /><br />The age of this sword is such that its true origin has been lost to time, but markings hint that it was possibly forged by those in the service of Helm. Also called the "Sword of Neutrality," it seems designed to seek and terminate extremism, to shift the universe closer to harmonious equilibrium. The further the orientation of a target from true balance, the more potent the damage they suffer.<br /><br />The Equalizer was last rumored to have been wielded by the elven hero Alaine Greenleaf, who was lost during a voyage to the Underdark, though the blade's pommel gem was stolen by an escaped slave who returned to the surface world.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to charm & confusion effects<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Equalizer: inflicts additional damage depending on target's alignment<br /> +0 vs. true neutral<br /> +2 vs. lawful/chaotic neutral<br /> +4 vs. neutral good/evil<br /> +6 vs. other alignments<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Lawful good/evil characters<br /> Chaotic good/evil characters|
| *SW1H60*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H60.png "Angurvadal +4") | **Angurvadal +4**<br /><br />There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry...or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough -- it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself -- but whoever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is...wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It shouldn't hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging suspicion that the blade was not made for him...or any other humanoid.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Flaming: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of fire damage<br /> Incendiary: inflicts 2 points of fire damage each round for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H61*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H61.png "Angurvadal +5") | **Angurvadal +5**<br /><br />There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry...or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough -- it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself -- but whoever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is...wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It shouldn't hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging suspicion that the blade was not made for him...or any other humanoid.<br /><br />The true power of this burning sword has been unleashed by the Liquid Mercury.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Flame Whip: target must save vs. breath or be entangled in flames for 2 rounds<br /> Flaming: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of fire damage<br /> Incendiary: inflicts 2 points of fire damage each round for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 5<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H73*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H73.png "Long Sword +3") | **Long Sword +3**<br /><br />These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. The blade hums slightly in your hand, the only overt evidence that magic runs through it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H77*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H77.png "The Answerer +4") | **The Answerer +4**<br /><br />The last swing of a battle is more important than the first. Such is the philosophy embodied in this powerful weapon. Although the strange design of The Answerer makes it difficult to take the initiative in combat, with each hit it makes an opponent more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Answerer: whenever struck by an opponent the wielder gains an additional attack the following round<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Pierce Magic: each hit reduces target's magic resistance by 5% for 4 rounds<br /> Sundering: each hit reduces target's armor class by 1 for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 10<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *WA2S1H*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WA2S1H.png "Blade of Sharpness +1") | **Blade of Sharpness +1**<br /><br />The Blade of Sharpness belonged to the renowed swordsman Cezarre and it really is an astonishing work of craftsmanship. This defensive keen rapier of speed is extremely light and sharp. It can be matched by few other swords and requires skilled and trained hands to wield.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilitites:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Keen: +15% chance to score critical hits<br /> Speed: +1 attack per round<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 16 Dexterity, 12 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Swashbuckler|
