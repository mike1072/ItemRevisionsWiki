| *DWHALB01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWHALB01.png "Drowcraft Halberd +3") | **Drowcraft Halberd +3**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft weapon is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wielder exceptional accuracy. Drowcraft weapons will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: +2 luck bonus to minimum damage and attack rolls<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 15<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB01.png "Halberd") | **Halberd**<br /><br />Consisting of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length, the halberd is the oldest and most often used polearm. The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke, and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design. The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry. A halberd is best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D10<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 9<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB02.png "Halberd +1") | **Halberd +1**<br /><br />Like others of its type, this halberd consists of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff approximately six feet in length. It has also been bestowed with a small number of magical properties, however, thus making it more effective in combat. Its keen blade, for instance, will shear through your opponent's flesh to find bone, while its barbed tip will seek out gaps in their armor.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 1<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB03.png "Suryris's Blade +2") | **Suryris's Blade +2**<br /><br />Suryris, a white minotaur who traveled the Orsraun mountains in Turmish, lived for nothing but the thrill of combat, and encouraged warriors to challenge him for his magical weapon: a powerful halberd. Despite his aggressive nature, he was an honorable combatant and never slew opponents he could overpower. Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat. The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryis knew he likely would have been bested had it continued. He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Slashing: creatures struck suffer 1D10 additional points of slashing damage<br /> Staggering: target must save vs. breath or be staggered for 1 round, suffering -1/2 reduced attack rate and -4 penalty to casting speed<br /> Unbalanced: -1/2  attack per round<br /><br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB04.png "Wyrmcleaver +3") | **Wyrmcleaver +3**<br /><br />This was the weapon of Thorvin Dukal, one of seven self-proclaimed Dragonslayers who spent years railing against what they called "an insidious dragon infestation that threatens Faerun." Thorvin had this weapon enchanted at great expense and used it on many occasions, though only a single dragon has fallen to it. The Dragonslayers met their match in a cantankerous ancient red who slew the entire group in an epic battle. This weapon did not end up in the beast's hoard, however, since the creature returned to its lair to recuperate; when it emerged, the field of combat was well scavenged.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Cleaving: with each successful hit there's a 33% chance of gaining one extra attack in the next round<br /> Dragon Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +8 to damage against dragons<br /> Keen: +10% chance to score critical hits<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 1<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB05.png "Dragon's Breath +3") | **Dragon's Breath +3**<br /><br />Trying to profit from the strength of greater beings, many years ago the mage Ullion founded a dragon-worshipping cult under the moniker "Son of Drago." Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold. When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent, it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold. Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor, who sought to rule. There was no real power to be had without the mage, so the entire organization soon collapsed on itself.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dragon's Breath: inflicts additional 1D10 points of either acid, cold, electrical, fire or poison damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB06.png "Blackmist +4") | **Blackmist +4**<br /><br />This was the weapon of Dominique Harl, a sightless paladin who frequently traveled Faerun. When attacked, Dominique would unleash the black mist that is this halberd's namesake, potentially blinding all within ten feet. This often gave him the advantage, for he lived in darkness all his life, seeing only with the inner light of faith. Dominique eventually fell, his body found in a dark forest, slain by a creature of the night even more at home in the shadows than he.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (three times per day):<br /> Black Mist: blinds everyone within 10' radius<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Blind-Fight: wielder fights without penalties even if unable to see and cannot be backstabbed<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB07.png "Halberd +2") | **Halberd +2**<br /><br />Consisting of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length, the halberd is the oldest and most often used polearm. The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke, and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design. The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry. A halberd is best described as a cross between a spear and an axe. This particular halberd is enchanted, gifted with an enhanced ability to slaughter foes.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB08.png "Duskblade +2") | **Duskblade +2**<br /><br />Though once a simple halberd, this weapon spent many hundreds of years in a tomb next to the soul phylactery of a powerful lich. The creature was eventually erased from existence, purportedly by another of its kind, but such close proximity to that concentrated evil has imbued this blade with the very essence of night and the chill of darkness, energy that becomes deadly in combat. It is a foul weapon, and a warrior should use it with caution.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Creeping Cold: inflicts 2 points of cold damage each round for 4 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Paladin<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB09.png "The Wave +4") | **The Wave +4**<br /><br />Forged in antiquity by a cult devoted to the goddess Umberlee, this weapon of vengeance was designed to aid the cult's champion in retrieving an even more powerful holy artifact from the fire giants of the Storm Horn Mountains. That was a lot of hope to place in one champion, and unfortunately The Wave disappeared along with them. It was eventually found by the adventurer Arganon of the Long Reach, who found it extremely useful during his planar travels, and The Wave soon became known on the Elemental Plane of Fire as "Clisirick", or "Fire Eater". Whether The Bitch Queen was hungry to retrieve the holy weapon or just took pleasure in unleashing her wrath, Arganon's ship was sunk during a great storm in the Sea of Swords and The Wave has been lost ever since.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Protection from Spell: Horrid Wilting<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Smashing Wave: 15% chance target and opponents within 5 feet suffer 4d6 points of crushing damage and must save vs. breath or be knocked unconscious for 1 round<br /> Fire Eating: efreeti, fire elementals, fire giants and fire salamanders struck by the Smashing Wave must save vs. death or be slayed<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Monk<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Beast Master|
| *HALB10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HALB10.png "Ravager +4") | **Ravager +4**<br /><br />The guards upon the walls of the evil fortress, Darkhold, carry halberds of ancient, demonic creation. The halberds were purchased from the forges of hell in trade for the souls of captured heroes, so each halberd is a valued possession. Those who wield these weapons outside the walls of Darkhold do so at their own peril, for the master of the hold is said to be linked to each one. Only taking the blood-soaked shaft of this weapon in hand brings a sudden chill along the spine and the very sight of this cursed halberd has been known to strike terror into the heart of an opponent.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (twice per day):<br /> Cloak of Fear<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dooming: target must save vs. spell or suffer -1 penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws for 4 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Beast Master|

Only taking the blood-soaked shaft of this weapon in hand brings a sudden chill along the spine and the very sight of this cursed halberd has been known to strike terror into the heart of an opponent.<br /><br />Combined with the Serpent Shaft, this dark halberd has the ability to slay an opponent with a single blow - unless they can survive the lethal poison injected by the vicious weapon.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (three times per day):<br /> Cloak of Fear<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dooming: target must save vs. spell or suffer -1 penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws for 4 rounds<br /> Viperous: 15% chance to inject a lethal poison which inflicts 10 points of damage every second for 2 rounds unless a save vs. poison at -4 penalty is made<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 5<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Paladin<br /> Thief<br /> Beast Master|
