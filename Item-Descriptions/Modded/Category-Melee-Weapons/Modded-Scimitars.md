| *DWSW1H01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWSW1H01.png "Drowcraft Scimitar +3") | **Drowcraft Scimitar +3**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft weapon is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wielder exceptional accuracy. Drowcraft weapons will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: +2 luck bonus to minimum damage and attack rolls<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H15.png "Icingdeath +3") | **Icingdeath +3**<br /><br />Frostbrand: 'Icingdeath'<br />It is one of Drizzt's personal weapons, specifically the one he usually holds in his right hand. Drizzt found Icingdeath in the treasure pile of Ingeloakastimizilian the white wyrm and this is where the weapon gets its name. The hilt of the scimitar is of black adamantite and the blade is made of silver with a diamond edge. The weapon absorbs fire and heat, protecting its wielder against fire, and this magical blade saved Drizzt's life every time he faced the demon Errtu.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Fire Resistance: +50% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Icy: deals 1D6 additional points of cold damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H16.png "Twinkle +3") | **Twinkle +3**<br /><br />Defensive Scimitar: 'Twinkle'<br />Twinkle is Icingdeath's companion scimitar, held in his left hand (and worn on his right hip). This defensive scimitar, forged by the Elves of old, was gifted to him by Malchor Harpell when the Companions of the Hall were chasing Artemis Entreri after he had kidnapped Regis. Twinkle has a star-cut sapphire on its pommel and when it detects danger nearby it softly glows blue.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H20.png "Scimitar") | **Scimitar**<br /><br />The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun. Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. Thus, it is slightly slower, but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D8<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H22.png "Scimitar +1") | **Scimitar +1**<br /><br />The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun. Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. Thus, it is slightly slower, but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This scimitar is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H23.png "Rashad's Talon +2") | **Rashad's Talon +2**<br /><br />Named for Prince Rashad, former ruler of a minor principality to the East, this blade and many of the Prince's possessions were taken by disgruntled palace guards after his death. The role of the guards in the unfortunate affair was never determined, but rumor has it that all died within a year, slain by this very weapon.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Cleaving: with each successful hit there's a 20% chance of gaining one extra attack in the next round<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H30*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H30.png "Belm +2") | **Belm +2**<br /><br />This legendary blade was wielded for a short time by the Tempest warrior Ilban of Elturel. It is from his exploits in Calimshan that the weapon gained its fame. Before Ilban, however, Belm was in the possession of a holy slayer from distant Zakhara. According to sages, the light sword was crafted to serve an order of assassins. Belm's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon. The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport. The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions. Ilban's exploits took Belm into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Quickness: +1/2 attack per round<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H50*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H50.png "Shazzellim +1") | **Shazzellim +1**<br /><br />This scimitar seems of rather poor quality but beneath its surface lies great power and evil. Created for the sole purpose of slaying Harpers, Shazzellim is more than capable of that task. With one strike of the blade a bard must make a saving throw vs. spells or die. Crafted by a Red Wizard of Thay, the sword also has the ability to vocalize, which is why it was often given to fighter-mages in the service of the Wizards. Needless to say, possession of this sword would not be looked upon very highly by Harpers.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Vocalize<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Any bard hit must make saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty or die<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H52*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H52.png "Water's Edge +3") | **Water's Edge +3**<br /><br />Due to their religious responsibilities, minions of Umberlee, are supposed to avoid personal entanglements with those who work the sea. Of course, even among those who follow dark gods, the pursuit of pleasure and emotional gratification often cause them to stray from their commandments. One priestess who strayed in such a fashion was Kalana Fisher. In 1357, she began a romance with the pirate captain Balhoderie. Though both were extremely flawed people with outrageous personalities and a complete lack of faithfulness, they had a strange mutual affection for each other. But while Balhoderie's great flaw was his mean temper, Kalana's was in holding grudges.<br />In 1366, Kalana tracked down the murderer of Balhoderie, a Talosian pirate captain named Madion. She planted information in Madion's spy network and anonymously offered him a tantalizing prize: three high-value merchant ships leaving the port of Baldur's Gate with few defenses. Low on money, Madion took the bait. He was slaughtered by the numerous guards that poured from the ships' holds.<br />As it had turned out, the merchant captain was a superstitious sort and had gone to the temple of Umberlee in Baldur's Gate for a divination. Without hesitation, the priestess Kalana had foretold a horrible attack outside the port. Not only did Kalana get her revenge, but the captain became a lifelong donator to the church of the Bitch Queen.<br />Nobody knows if Water's Edge, the blade Kalane had crafted for Balhoderie, was somehow retreived by the priestess herself or got lost in the ocean.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Sharpness: target must save vs. death or suffer -1 penalty to strength and dexterity for 5 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H53*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H53.png "Sword of Flame +1") | **Sword of Flame +1**<br /><br />Desert Wind<br />If rumors of Calimshite ancestry are true, then this type of scimitar is likely the product of the genies that founded the city long ago. All of the raging heat of the desert seems to be captured within the blade of the sword. Tales of enemies surrendering after suffering a mere scratch only seem true after one has tasted the blistering pain this flaming sword causes a wound.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Flaming: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of fire damage<br /> Fiery Blow: 10% chance of dealing 20 additional points of fire damage<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|

| *SW1H68*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H68.png "Spectral Brand +3") | **Spectral Brand +3**<br /><br />When examined in direct sunlight, this mysterious scimitar becomes transparent and faint, almost disappearing from sight. As the lighting grows dimmer, however, the sword seems almost to gain substance from the darkness until it glows with a gray light in total darkness.<br />Legend has it that the souls of those who fall beneath this dark blade are forever enslaved, and can be summoned to fight at the side of the one who defeated them. Though this legendary power seems somehow sealed, Spectral Brand is still able to create an illusionary copy of itself capable of fighting alongside the wielder, and the chilling touch of its blade attacks directly the life force of any living creature.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Spectral Blade: this dancing sword fights on behalf of the one who wields Spectral Brand for 1 turn. The illusionary sword acts as a +3 weapon, has THAC0 3 and attacks once each round inflicting 1d8+3 magic damage. It has 36 hit points, AC 5, 100% resistance to all damage except for pure magic damage, and is immune to mind affecting spells<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Ghost Blade: the ghostly blade bypasses most armors, granting additional +3 bonus on attack rolls<br /> Chill Touch: creatures struck suffer 1D3 additional points of cold damage and must save vs. death or lose 1 point of strength<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H69*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H69.png "Spectral Brand +4") | **Spectral Brand +4**<br /><br />When examined in direct sunlight, this mysterious scimitar becomes transparent and faint, almost disappearing from sight. As the lighting grows dimmer, however, the sword seems almost to gain substance from the darkness until it glows with a gray light in total darkness.<br />Legend has it that the souls of those who fall beneath this dark blade are forever enslaved, and can be summoned to fight at the side of the one who defeated them. Though this legendary power seems somehow sealed, Spectral Brand is still able to create an illusionary copy of itself capable of fighting alongside the wielder, and the chilling touch of its blade attacks directly the life force of any living creature.<br /><br />Drawing upon the necromancy of the Skull of the Lich the seal has been broken, and Spectral Brand is now an instrument of unholy death that should never have been unleashed upon the Realms.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Dark Swarm: releases enslaved souls in the form of shadows, summoning one creature every round for 1 turn<br /> Spectral Blade: this dancing sword fights on behalf of the one who wields Spectral Brand for 1 turn. The sword acts as a +4 weapon, has THAC0 2 and attacks once each round inflicting 1d8+4 magic damage.

The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. Thus, it is slightly slower, but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to augment the skill of the wielder.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
