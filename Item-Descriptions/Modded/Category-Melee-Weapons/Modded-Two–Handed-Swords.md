| *REAVER*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/REAVER.png "Unholy Reaver +5") | **Unholy Reaver +5**<br /><br />This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance and is only usable by anti-paladins.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +25% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dispelling: removes all magical effects upon the target (save vs. spell neg.)<br /> Unholy: deals 6 additional points of damage against all of good alignment<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 5<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Anti-paladin|
| *NPSW03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPSW03.png "Hallowed Redeemer +2") | **Hallowed Redeemer +2**<br /><br />Keldorn distinguished himself early in his career as a paladin, and since he was ordered this powerful sword has always been at his side. The blessed weapon is imbued with holy power, and it has been forged to eradicate any source of evil wherever it lies. Furthermore the inquisitor's blade is the bane of evil practitioners of arcane and divine magic alike because of it's power to silence which leave them defenceless while judgement falls upon them.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Heretic's Doom: silence target for 2 rounds (save vs. spell neg.)<br /> Holy: deals 3 additional points of damage against all of evil alignment<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Keldorn|
| *FINSAREV*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/FINSAREV.png "Sword of Chaos +4") | **Sword of Chaos +4**<br /><br />The blade of Sarevok, brother of <CHARNAME>, used in the battle they fought in faraway Baldur's Gate.  <CHARNAME> prevailed, destroying Sarevok's plans and rescuing the Sword Coast from the brink of war. Now Sarevok has joined with <CHARNAME>'s cause and his blade has been restored to him.  Sarevok describes the weapon as a Deathbringer blade and has restored some of the weapon's old power. Without his Bhaalspawn essence to channel through the sword, however, it cannot achieve the power it once had. Still, however, it is a formidable weapon...and one that Sarevok warns would become increasingly difficult to wield in the hands of one who was not a Deathbringer, if they could use it at all.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Vampiric: drains one to four hit points from the target and transfers it to the wielder<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 18 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Sarevok|
| *SW2H01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H01.png "Two-Handed Sword") | **Two-Handed Sword**<br /><br />The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons, and in an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D10<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 10<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H02.png "Two-Handed Sword +1") | **Two-Handed Sword +1**<br /><br />The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons, and in an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This sword is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 9<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H03.png "Berserking Sword +3") | **Berserking Sword +3**<br /><br />This is a cursed sword which performs perfectly under every test, save in the heat of battle. Upon entering combat, the wielder will immediately go berserk, killing everything within reach until either calming down or falling unconscious. A very powerful sword, but one must decide whether or not it is worth the risk. Even after the battle fury has ended, this sword can only be removed via a Remove Curse spell.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Berserking: the wielder goes berserk and totally out of control whenever a fight takes place<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Speed: +1 attack per round<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 16 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Paladin<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H06.png "Spider's Bane +2") | **Spider's Bane +2**<br /><br />Spider's Bane was originally forged by the dwarves of the Orothiar tribe in Cloakwood. They created the blade to help foster good will between them and the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. Wielded by the Grand Dukes for about a century, the sword was eventually lost in a fight against ettercaps and spiders. The present whereabouts of the blade are unknown, but its recovery would aid greatly in fighting the current spider infestation that plagues the Cloakwood.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to web & poison effects<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H07.png "Harbinger +3") | **Harbinger +3**<br /><br />When the hero Trueblood destroyed the Harbinger, a demon gorging itself on the blood of peasant folk near Luskan, he bound its essence in the only vessel capable of holding it, his fabled sword, Deliverance. Though the evil creature was dominated by the will of the semi-sentient blade, it was not truly defeated, and it transformed the weapon from within. Now it acts much like any other enchanted weapon, but when it strikes, there is a chance that a burst of flames erupts, a sign that the demon within still rages at its imprisonment.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Hellfire: 5% chance on each hit wielder must save vs. spell or suffer 20 points of fire damage<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Banishing: summoned creatures must save vs. spell or be dismissed<br /> Demon Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +8 to damage against demons<br /> Starmetal: inflicts 4 additional points of damage against extraplanar creatures<br /> <br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 9<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H08.png "Soul Reaver +4") | **Soul Reaver +4**<br /><br />Thirsting for fresh blood, usually only a warrior intent on death and destruction wields such an evil blade. Some warriors claiming to be doing good have attempted to master the Soul Reaver and use it for noble purposes, but more often than not, they are found surrounded by carnage and death too horrible to bear. One such warrior was found in a cathedral, surrounded by the corpses of priests and resting on the end of his own blade, where he had thrown himself in a fit of guilt.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Enervating: living creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of damage and must save vs. death or lose 1 level<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 16 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Good-aligned characters|
| *SW2H09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H09.png "Warblade +3") | **Warblade +3**<br /><br />This massive two-handed sword is an enchanted version of the barbaric swords of the Northern tribes. Forged during battle and dipped in the blood of the brave fallen, the enchantment granted to the blade by the barbarian gods is incredible. This huge 52'' long blade needs much effort to be properly handled, thus only the strongest warriors can hope to wield such a powerful tool of destruction.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Bluntness: +2D3 crushing damage<br /> Oversized: less accurate but more damaging than a normal-sized two-handed sword<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D12 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 18 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H10.png "Carsomyr +4") | **Carsomyr +4**<br /><br />The Holy Avenger<br />Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, so that the sword itself will never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today. It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it. The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, for their magic is dispelled with a word, and steadfastly resisted with ease. Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Dispel Magic: dispels all magical effects upon any creature in a 30 feet radius<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +20% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dispelling: removes all magical effects upon the target (save vs. spell neg.)<br /> Holy: deals 3 additional points of damage against all of evil alignment<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 16 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Paladins|
| *SW2H11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H11.png "Two-Handed Sword +2") | **Two-Handed Sword +2**<br /><br />The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons, and in an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This particular sword is even more capable of such functions, serving as a fearful reminder of what comes of the union between weaponsmithing and sorcery.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H12.png "Flame of the North +2") | **Flame of the North +2**<br /><br />The title does not refer to the blade itself, though appropriate, but rather to the woman who originally wielded it in the icy hinterlands of Faerun. Her name was Carerra, and she was a veritable firestorm that swept across arctic trolls and the northern orcish tribes. She was a hated enemy of many a shaman whose magic often floundered against her berserker's fury. After a lifetime of raucous battle, it was old age that eventually claimed her. The sword was passed to her granddaughter, an adventurer, who presumably brought it to Amn.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities<br /> Icy: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of cold damage<br /> Freezing: 50% chance target must save vs. polymorph or be held for 1 round<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H13.png "Spider's Bane +2") | **Spider's Bane +2**<br /><br />Spider's Bane was originally forged by the dwarves of the Orothiar tribe in Cloakwood. They created the blade to help foster good will between them and the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. Wielded by the Grand Dukes for about a century, the sword was eventually lost in a fight against ettercaps and spiders. The present whereabouts of the blade are unknown, but its recovery would aid greatly in fighting the current spider infestation that plagues the Cloakwood.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to web & poison effects<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H14.png "Lilarcor +3") | **Lilarcor +3**<br /><br />Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance".<br />It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.<br />As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt", "Oh yeah! Got 'im good", and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to charm & confusion effects<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H15.png "Silver Sword +4") | **Silver Sword +4**<br /><br />This vorpal Silver Sword radiates a dark aura when you examine it, and the blade is so finely sharpened, it could likely sever a head in a single blow. These swords are highly sought after, and a cult of githyanki knights called the 'Sword Stalkers' is tasked with recovering any swords that fall into the hands of the unworthy, i.e. non githyanki.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Keen: +10% chance to score critical hits<br /> Vorpal: 15% chance target must save vs. death at -2 penalty or die<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Paladin<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H16.png "Sword of Chaos +2") | **Sword of Chaos +2**<br /><br />The blade of Sarevok, brother of <CHARNAME>, used in the battle they fought in faraway Baldur's Gate. <CHARNAME> prevailed, destroying Sarevok's plans and rescuing the Sword Coast from the brink of war. The sword itself defies identification, likely forged specifically for Sarevok to best focus the infernal energy he hoped to control. Much of its power died with him.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Vampiric: drains 1D4 hit points from the target and transfers it to the wielder<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H17.png "Gram the Sword of Grief +4") | **Gram the Sword of Grief +4**<br /><br />Some weapons are evil from their inception, imbued with corrupting magics by cruel mages. But there are also weapons that owe their natures not to any particular enchantment, but to dastardly acts performed in the hands of their wielders. Gram, once a legendary sword of the great hero Siegfried, is now forever stained with the blood of countless innocents.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Sharpness: target must save vs. death or suffer -1 penalty to strength and dexterity for 5 rounds<br /> Envenomed: 20% chance of dealing 2D12 additional points of poison damage<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H18.png "Gram the Sword of Grief +5") | **Gram the Sword of Grief +5**<br /><br />Some weapons are evil from their inception, imbued with corrupting magics by cruel mages. But there are also weapons that owe their natures not to any particular enchantment, but to dastardly acts performed in the hands of their wielders. Gram, once a legendary sword of the great hero Siegfried, is now forever stained with the blood of countless innocents.<br /><br />Siegfried's fearsome blade is even more powerful with the Heart of the Damned set into its pommel.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +15% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Wounding: target suffer 1 point of bleeding damage every round for 5 rounds<br /> Sharpness: target must save vs. death or suffer -1 penalty to strength and dexterity for 5 rounds<br /> Envenomed: 20% chance of dealing 2D12 additional points of poison damage<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 5<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H19.png "Carsomyr +5") | **Carsomyr +5**<br /><br />The Holy Avenger<br />Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, so that the sword itself will never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today. It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it. The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, for their magic is dispelled with a word, and steadfastly resisted with ease. Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.<br /><br />Even a Holy Relic as powerful as Carsomyr is made even greater when combined with the Eye of Tyr.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Dispel Magic: dispels all magical effects upon any creature in a 30 feet radius<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +25% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dispelling: removes all magical effects upon the target (save vs. spell neg.)<br /> Holy: deals 6 additional points of damage against all of evil alignment<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 5<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 16 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Paladins|
| *SW2H20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H20.png "Two-Handed Sword +3") | **Two-Handed Sword +3**<br /><br />The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons, and in an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This particular sword is even more capable of such functions, serving as a fearful reminder of what comes of the union between weaponsmithing and sorcery.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW2H21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW2H21.png "Psion's Blade +3") | **Psion's Blade +3**<br /><br />Some believe this massive blade to be of Drow origin, though others dispute this claim. However, all agree this great sword was fashioned with a single purpose... to rid the world of the Illithid. A threat Mind Flayers don't take kindly.<br />The illithid brain known as Kwukgixrin sent its followers to scouring the underdark for this blade that it discovered when it absorbed the mind of a powerful human warrior. After countless fights the warrior had hidden the sword when he realized that he was too wounded to survive another attack from the illithid thralls. Before the illithid thralls could find the sword, the warrior's twin brother discovered it. The twin was in strong health and he made short work of the thralls and many illithids before leaving the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Mind Barrier: +2 bonus to AC and saving throws vs. psionics<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Mindbreaking: 15% chance target must save vs. spell at -4 or be feebleminded<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D10 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
