| *BLUN04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN04.png "Mace") | **Mace**<br /><br />The mace is a direct descendent of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The design of the head varies: some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN05.png "Mace +1") | **Mace +1**<br /><br />The mace is a direct descendent of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The design of the head varies: some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs. This mace is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN11.png "Mace +2") | **Mace +2**<br /><br />The mace is a direct descendent of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The design of the head varies: some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs. The shaft of this magical mace seems to guide the wielder, becoming an extension of his or her hand.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN12.png "Mace of Disruption +3") | **Mace of Disruption +3**<br /><br />Possibly the singular most popular weapon amongst the ranks of Lathander's clerics, the mace of disruption is the bane of the undead. It is rumored that the last cleric carrying such a weapon in Thay was caught by Szazz Tam and flayed alive, before being turned into a zombie servant.<br />This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead. Any undead creature hit by it not only feels the sting of the weapon, but also has a chance of being blasted from existence. There are legends that speak of a priest so holy that a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Disruption: undead creatures must save vs. spell or be destroyed<br /> Undead Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +6 to damage against undead<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN18.png "Skullcrusher +3") | **Skullcrusher +3**<br /><br />This mace is permanently bloodstained, a telltale trace of its many years spent bashing heads. The weapon would have been the bane of humanoids throughout its history, but those who wielded it seem to have been purposely left out of historic records.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Bone Breaking: each hit reduces target's maximum hit points by 3 for 1 turn<br /> Crushing Blow: 5% chance of dealing 20 additional points of crushing damage<br /> Human Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +6 to damage against humanoids<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN19.png "Mauler's Arm +1") | **Mauler's Arm +1**<br /><br />Jurrg the Mauler was a proud chieftain of a northern tribe, but feared he would be the last of his family to lead. His son Kullen was sickly, and clearly couldn't meet the traditional requirement of strength for a chieftain. Jurrg knew that wise leadership took more than brawn, however, so he conspired to enchant this mace such that it would cover Kullen's weakness. Who Jurrg made the deal with is unknown, but the cost was apparently high. Kullen came to rule soon after.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Strength: +2 bonus (+75 exceptional)<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN20.png "Ardulia's Fall +2") | **Ardulia's Fall +2**<br /><br />Ardulia the Agile was a man whose speed and skill at knife play made him exceptionally lethal in battle, and he repeatedly proved it by leading raids on settlements along the Sword Coast. He would often challenge the village leader for possession of the town, and with his speed, the duels were always quickly decided in his favor. Ardulia met his match one spring morn however, when he battled the priest Itgan, who wielded this mace. Ardulia seemed to stagger under each blow, slowing his pace to recoup and regain his breath. Without his speed, Ardulia was lost, and fell to the measured attacks of Itgan.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Enfeebling: target must save vs. spell or be slowed, and suffer -1 penalty to attack rolls and armor class for 1 round<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN21.png "Mace +2") | **Mace +2**<br /><br />The mace is a direct descendent of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The design of the head varies: some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs. The shaft of this magical mace seems to guide the wielder, becoming an extension of his or her hand.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN25*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN25.png "Mace of Disruption +4") | **Mace of Disruption +4**<br /><br />Possibly the singular most popular weapon amongst the ranks of Lathander's clerics, the mace of disruption is the bane of the undead. It is rumored that the last cleric carrying such a weapon in Thay was caught by Szazz Tam and flayed alive, before being turned into a zombie servant.<br />This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead. Any undead creature hit by it not only feels the sting of the weapon, but also has a chance of being blasted from existence. There are legends that speak of a priest so holy that a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians.<br /><br />Now that the mace has been coated with illithium, it is even more potent, conferring to its user immunity to the life-draining powers of the more potent undead.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to level drain effects<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Disruption: undead creatures must save vs. spell or be destroyed<br /> Undead Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +6 to damage against undead<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN28*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN28.png "Storm Star +3") | **Storm Star +3**<br /><br />This magical weapon is of ancient design, which scholars have linked to Netheril itself. Though such electrum plated maces as Storm Star are usually found in the North, there are whispered rumors of this particularly powerful specimen being lost in the Southern reaches of the Realms.<br />Despite its massive size, Storm Star is surprisingly light, making it particularly easy to wield in combat. It crackles with spectacular arcs of lightning when wielded, a visible manifestation of the powerful electrical enchantments infused within the weapon's head.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Shocking: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of electrical damage<br /> Chain Lightning: 15% chance arcs of lightning leap at all enemies inflicting 3D6 points of electrical damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN29*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN29.png "Storm Star +4") | **Storm Star +4**<br /><br />This magical weapon is of ancient design, which scholars have linked to Netheril itself. Though such electrum plated maces as Storm Star are usually found in the North, there are whispered rumors of this particularly powerful specimen being lost in the Southern reaches of the Realms.<br />Despite its massive size, Storm Star is surprisingly light, making it particularly easy to wield in combat. It crackles with spectacular arcs of lightning when wielded, a visible manifestation of the powerful electrical enchantments infused within the weapon's head.<br /><br />Storm Star's already formidable abilities have been further enhanced by the addition of the otherworldly Starfall Ore. This strange material comes from the core of a meteorite, which fell from the heavens. The malleable ore is surprisingly strong, and radiates an inner heat. Any item forged from the alien matter would undoubtedly possess mysterious and unearthly properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Shocking: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of electrical damage<br /> Chain Lightning: 15% chance arcs of lightning leap at all enemies inflicting 3D6 points of electrical damage<br /> Call Lightning: 5% chance to call down a lightning storm upon the target; each round for 4 rounds one opponent is struck for 4D6 points of electrical damage<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 5<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *BLUN33*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN33.png "Mace +3") | **Mace +3**<br /><br />The mace is a direct descendent of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The design of the head varies: some are spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs. In this case, the head is pyramidal, and seems to glow with an inner blue light as it sits atop a polished oak shaft.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HLOLTH*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HLOLTH.png "Handmaiden's Mace +3") | **Handmaiden's Mace +3**<br /><br />Handmaiden's Mace +3|
