| *BLUN01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN01.png "Club") | **Club**<br /><br />Most clubs are stout, hardwood sticks, narrow at the grip and wider at the end. This simple weapon has been used since mankind first began using tools. Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it; hence the club's widespread use.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D6<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *BLUN10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN10.png "The Root of the Problem +3") | **The Root of the Problem +3**<br /><br />This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. Although civilized areas were affected considerably, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those who remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land, taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed upon the item its ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Entangling: 33% chance target must save vs. breath or be entangled for 2 rounds<br /> Monster Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +6 to damage against monsters<br /><br />THAC0: +1<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Druid|
| *BLUN22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN22.png "Blackblood +2") | **Blackblood +2**<br /><br />This oak club is coated with darkened, dried globs of a tar-like substance. During battle this substance glows black with an inner light, and becomes thick and fluid. When the club strikes an opponent, it delivers additional acid damage from the liquid splashing over the victim.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Acidic: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of acid damage<br /> Acid Splash: 10% chance of inflicting 4D4 points of acid damage to target and opponents within 5 feet<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *BLUN23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN23.png "Bone Club +3") | **Bone Club +3**<br /><br />This vicious club was created hundreds of years ago, reportedly by a shaman on a quest for revenge. His family had fallen to undead, and so personal was his rage that he amputated his own leg, using the femur for the body of the weapon. Magical runes empower it, though it is likely the sheer force of his hatred would have served on its own.<br /><br />Notes: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dooming: target must save vs. spell or suffer -1 penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls and saving throws for 4 rounds<br /> Undead Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +6 to damage against undead<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *BLUN24*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN24.png "Gnasher +2") | **Gnasher +2**<br /><br />Makal of the Pine, a devious druid, carved this club and bonded it with the spirit of his wolverine companion. Like that tenacious creature, Gnasher is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user. When the club strikes, sharp splinters dig into the victim's flesh, causing extreme pain and even extra damage that continues for some time after the blow. Makal used the club successfully on several occasions, earning the anger of orc loggers threatening his forests.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Slivers: inflicts 2 points of piercing damage each round for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *BLUN26*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN26.png "Club of Detonation +3") | **Club of Detonation +3**<br /><br />Amnish fable tells the tale of Nysrogh, a powerful denizen of the lower planes unleashed upon Amn by a careless sorceress named Unileth.<br />Completely immune to any and all weapons used against him, Nysrogh rampaged throughout Amn, and Unileth took it upon herself to end the threat she had unleashed. Using her knowledge of the demon's weaknesses, she constructed a great club to defeat Nysrogh, and gave it to a brave but anonymous knight to be her champion.<br />Unileth's champion issued a challenge to Nysrogh, which the demon readily accepted, confident it could not be harmed by any weaponry known to the Realms. On the field of battle they met and beneath the fierce gaze of Nysrogh, Unileth's champion promptly dropped his weapon and fled in terror.<br />Nysrogh reached out to claim the champion's discarded club as a symbol of his victory. But as the demon's clawed hand touched the surface of the club he was encircled by a spell of imprisonment, for which he was completely unprepared. Unileth's ploy had worked, and the demon that could not be harmed by any weapon was forever trapped inside the magic club.<br /><br />The crude wooden club still burns with the raging spirit of the demon forever trapped within by the powerful enchantments placed on the weapon. Occasionally, however, the demon's wrath manages to escape in a fiery blast.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to normal weapons<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Detonation: 5% chance of inflicting 6D6 points of fire damage to target and opponents within 15 feet<br /> Flaming: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of fire damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *BLUN27*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BLUN27.png "Club of Detonation +4") | **Club of Detonation +4**<br /><br />Amnish fable tells the tale of Nysrogh, a powerful denizen of the lower planes unleashed upon Amn by a careless sorceress named Unileth.<br />Completely immune to any and all weapons used against him, Nysrogh rampaged throughout Amn, and Unileth took it upon herself to end the threat she had unleashed. Using her knowledge of the demon's weaknesses, she constructed a great club to defeat Nysrogh, and gave it to a brave but anonymous knight to be her champion.<br />Unileth's champion issued a challenge to Nysrogh, which the demon readily accepted, confident it could not be harmed by any weaponry known to the Realms.

But as the demon's clawed hand touched the surface of the club he was encircled by a spell of imprisonment, for which he was completely unprepared. Unileth's ploy had worked, and the demon that could not be harmed by any weapon was forever trapped inside the magic club.<br /><br />The enchantments from the Ring of Fire Resistance makes the demon spirit trapped within this weapon easier to control, though the wrath of the creature may occasionally still be released without warning.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Protection from Magical Weapons<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to normal weapons<br /> Fire Resistance: +40% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Detonation: 10% chance of inflicting 6D6 points of fire damage to target and opponents within 15 feet<br /> Flaming: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of fire damage<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|

This simple weapon has been used since mankind first began using tools. Anyone can find a good stout piece of wood and swing it; hence the club's widespread use. This particular club has been magically enhanced.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
