| *NPSW01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPSW01.png "Sword of Arvoreen +2") | **Sword of Arvoreen +2**<br /><br />Another gift to Mazzy from Arvoreen, this short sword may only be used by halflings. Its enchantments give it the ability to slow any opponent it strikes.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Enfeebling: target must save vs. spell or be slowed, and suffer -1 penalty to attack rolls and armor class for 1 round<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Halfling|
| *NPSW05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPSW05.png "Entropy +2") | **Entropy +2**<br /><br />This Baatorian green steel blade is one of Haer'Dalis' favorite weapons. This sickly green metal is very rarely found outside of the Outer Planes. This is because the ore needed to make the metal is only found on the lower planes, specifically the Nine Hells of Baator. The most common users of baatorian green steel are the baatezu themselves, who use weapons and armors made of this metal in the Blood War (their eternal fight against the tanar'ri). This metal is also known as banesteel due to the fact that weapons made of green steel strike more often and are able to penetrate armor very easily. Due to its heritage this short sword is usable only by tieflings.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Entropy: each hit reduces target's saves vs. spell by 1 for 4 rounds<br /> Envenomed: creatures struck suffer 1D6 points of additional poison damage<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Tieflings|
| *NPSW06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPSW06.png "Chaos +2") | **Chaos +2**<br /><br />This Tanar'ri red steel blade is one of Haer'Dalis' favorite weapons. This rare metal is another product of the Blood War and the Lower Planes. In this case, the metal is crafted in the infinite layers of the Abyss and is used primarily by the tanar'ri. Red steel is also known as bloodsteel. Besides being the color of fresh blood, weapons made from red steel have a tendency to cause horrific wounds. Haer'Dalis prefers using Chaos with its partner -- Entropy. When dual-wielding these two blades, Haer'Dalis surely is a dangerous opponent. Due to its heritage this short sword is usable only by tieflings.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Wounding: target suffer 2 points of bleeding damage every round for 2 rounds<br /> Chaos: 20% chance target must save vs. spell or be confused for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Tieflings|
| *SW1H07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H07.png "Short Sword") | **Short Sword**<br /><br />The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term 'short sword' does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D6<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H08.png "Short Sword +1") | **Short Sword +1**<br /><br />The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term 'short sword' does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting. This short sword is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H09.png "Short Sword +2") | **Short Sword +2**<br /><br />This short sword was forged by hands both magical and highly skilled. Neither nick nor stain mar the flawless blade. When used in battle, the blade radiates magic and gifts the wielder with increased skill.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H10.png "Short Sword of Backstabbing +3") | **Short Sword of Backstabbing +3**<br /><br />The Shadow's Blade<br />A rogue's dream, these weapons were commissioned by the Shadow Thieves to bolster their fledgling guild chapter in Baldur's Gate. Seen as a threat to local interests, they now face stiff resistance from the existing thieves' guild and law enforcement for the city, the Flaming Fist. Deaths have occurred, so a few of these items are beginning to surface on the black market.<br />The Shadow's Blade was created to be the perfect assassin's tool. It is highly sought after by any who settle differences with a blade, and many that possess it do not do so for long.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities (thieves only):<br /> Backstabbing: increases backstab multiplier by 1<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H25*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H25.png "Kundane +2") | **Kundane +2**<br /><br />Sword of Quickness<br />Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers. In his loneliness, he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet. There Galloma, a wizard living in the area, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends, and more: they were master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's apprenticeship could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world. Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma. Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced his weak body.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Quickness: +1/2 attack per round<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H26*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H26.png "Ilbratha +1") | **Ilbratha +1**<br /><br />Mistress of Battle<br />This ancient bronze sword is set with six matching bloodstones, and gains its name from its illusionary powers, which are very useful in combat.<br />Ilbratha was created by unknown hands at the behest of Azoun the First, long dead king of Cormyr. He bore it once into battle, at Ithmong in his war with Tethyr, and then lost it in a storm that wrecked his ship on the rocks of The Neck. All trace of it was lost until, 200 winters later, the sage Thallastam of Procampur was offered the blade for 1,500 gold pieces by a peddler from a nearby town who seemed ignorant of its true nature. Thallastam brought the blade to Elminster in Shadowdale, the only loremaster with an interest in swords whom he trusted. Elminster identified the blade from the writings of Azoun I (the old king's great-grandson had just come to the throne), and Thallastam bore it back toward Procampur by way of Tilver's Gap and Essembra. But he was never seen again, and did not reach Procampur. His ruined diary, staff, and a skeleton were found some years later when the Pool of Yeven in Battledale was dragged, but the sword was never found.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Mirror Image (1 turn)<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Translucent: +2 bonus to AC<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H27*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H27.png "Arbane's Sword +2") | **Arbane's Sword +2**<br /><br />Arbane's Sword of Agility<br />The first of these swords were created by the elf wizard, Lord Arbane of Myth Drannor many centuries ago. His first was stolen, so he made a second with the aid of an apprentice, who sold the secret to two other wizard-swordsmiths. The form of manufacture is thought to be forgotten now -Elminster has heard of no one making one in the last 500 years- but there are over a dozen in existence. Some have even been created with sentience and further powers.<br />One of many created in the name of the mage who first discovered how to enchant a blade in this manner, this was the weapon of the outlaw Garno, and many a cleric died at its edge. Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge. Despite his focussed hatred of the devout, it is thought that one of the gods of chaos had a hand in Garno's acquisition of this sword, delighting in the havoc that followed the young man.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to entangle, grease, slow & web<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Hastening: 10% chance to gain +1/2 attack per round, and +2 bonus to movement rate for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H28*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H28.png "Cutthroat +3") | **Cutthroat +3**<br /><br />This weapon has a bloody history, having been used to perform its namesake many times. Popular among the assassin trade for its size and enchantment, it has been in the possession of many of the Realms' more dangerous citizens, though seldom remaining in one place for any length of time.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Cutthroating: target must save vs. death or be silenced for 3 rounds while suffering 1 point of bleeding damage every 3 seconds<br /> Slashing: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of slashing damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H29*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H29.png "Short Sword +2") | **Short Sword +2**<br /><br />The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term 'short sword' does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting. There are etched runes on the surface of this weapon that glow during combat, indicating it has undergone some form of enchantment, but no identifying marks can be found.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
| *SW1H58*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SW1H58.png "Short Sword of Mask +4") | **Short Sword of Mask +4**<br /><br />Godsbane Legacy<br />This blade is highly prized by those who serve the Shadowlord, as well as any who engage in shadowy business.<br />Godsbane was the sword form assumed by Mask during the Time of Troubles. He would eventually come to be wielded by the then-mortal Cyric, who acquired the sword by murdering a halfling named Sneakabout, who in turn killed the former wielder of the sword.<br />Cyric named the sword "Godsbane" because while he was a mortal, he used it to slay Bhaal (then Lord of Murder), and after becoming a deity, he used it to kill Leira, Lady of Deception.<br />The soon-to-become Prince of Lies also used it to kill Kelemvor Lyonsbane while atop Blackstaff Tower, but to spite Cyric for trying to break his will while he was a mortal, Mask as Godsbane hid Kelemvor's soul from him. During a revolt in the City of Strife that marked the end of Cyric's reign as Lord of the Dead, Cyric learned of this and snapped the blade in two. This revealed the sword to be an aspect of Mask, the god of thievery and intrigue. By doing this, Cyric greatly weakened Mask and gained the portfolio of intrigue, along with shadowy characteristics. For this, Mask hates Cyric, and he continuously plots ways to recover his lost portfolio.<br />Whether this blade is one of the original sword's reproductions, or another of Mask's attempts to seek his revenge is beyond anyone's knowledge.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Stealthblade: 20% chance of making the user improved invisible for 5 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 4<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|

For this, Mask hates Cyric, and he continuously plots ways to recover his lost portfolio.<br />Whether this blade is one of the original sword's reproductions, or another of Mask's attempts to seek his revenge is beyond anyone's knowledge.<br /><br />Combined with the Heart of the Damned into a single lethal weapon, this deadly blade is now an unmatched tool of assassins and thieves.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Envenomed: creatures struck suffer 1D6 points of additional poison damage<br /> Paralyzing: 50% chance target must save vs. paralyze or be held for 2 rounds<br /> Stealthblade: 20% chance of making the user improved invisible for 5 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 5<br />Damage type piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Beast Master|
