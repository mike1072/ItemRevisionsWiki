| *NPSTAF*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/NPSTAF.png "Staff of the High Forest +2") | **Staff of the High Forest +2**<br /><br />This staff finds its origin within a cycle of seasons in which Cernd meditated on his role within nature. His perch for this personal journey was next to a sapling, a young oak that was of particular interest; it seemed odd, and yet somehow wonderfully ordered. At the coming of spring Cernd examined it one last time, and it came loose in his hands, a living staff, granted as a boon from nature herself. It has grown to fit his grip, and no other may wield it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Casting speed: +1 bonus<br /> Elemental Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Cernd|
| *STAF01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF01.png "Quarterstaff") | **Quarterstaff**<br /><br />The simplest and humblest of staff weapons, the quarterstaff is a length of wood ranging six to nine feet in length. High quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends. The quarterstaff must be wielded with both hands.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D6<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF02.png "Quarterstaff +1") | **Quarterstaff +1**<br /><br />The simplest and humblest of staff weapons, the quarterstaff is a length of wood ranging six to nine feet in length. High quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends. This one is particularly special as it has been imbued with magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF03.png "Quarterstaff") | **Quarterstaff**<br /><br />The simplest and humblest of staff weapons, the quarterstaff is a length of wood ranging six to nine feet in length. High quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends. The quarterstaff must be wielded with both hands.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D6<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF05.png "Staff of Striking +3") | **Staff of Striking +3**<br /><br />Staves of Striking are made by the Gold Elves of Drelagara on Evermeet. Such staves seem to have a life of their own, and jump to attack in their bearer's hands. The elven craftsmen rarely sell them to other races, but these powerful melee weapons do surface occasionally in Faerun. This weapon can inflict tremendous damage, but each attack made with it partially consumes the energy of the staff, causing it to destroy itself when no charges remain. If it's not destroyed, the staff fully recharges itself each morning.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Striking: creatures struck suffer 6 additional points of crushing damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF06.png "Staff Mace +2") | **Staff Mace +2**<br /><br />This weapon appears to be a normal walking staff, but it has a faint aura of alteration magic. Uttering the command word causes the staff to assume the attributes of a mace, allowing it to be wielded with one hand. This was likely designed for priests or druids, though that does not preclude its use by most others.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 2<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monks|
| *STAF07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF07.png "Staff Spear +2") | **Staff Spear +2**<br /><br />When examined, this quarterstaff has an aura of alteration, and a long sharp spearhead extends from its upper end on command. Likely made by a wizard or priest hoping to increase their melee abilities, it can be used by anyone capable of handling a staff.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF08.png "Martial Staff +2") | **Martial Staff +2**<br /><br />This humble staff radiates powerful magic, and was likely the weapon of a traveling martial artist. It would certainly prove more than ample for dealing with most threats encountered on the road.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Parry: +2 bonus to AC (none vs. missile)<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Impact: +10% chance to score critical hits<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF09.png "Staff of Command +3") | **Staff of Command +3**<br /><br />This item is of the kind used by nefarious people seeking to sway others to follow their ways. Enchanters are often found wielding staves such as this, but this unique specimen belonged to Morinth the Bewitcher.<br />This staff allows the wielder to dominate another creature's mind, or destroy it with a strike, but the staff's ability to enhance the potency of all enchantments cast by its wielder is what mindbenders seek the most. <br />Possessing the power to manipulate other's minds doesn't ensure immunity to the same treatment, as Morinth's death proved when she was ambushed and abducted by a group of mind flayers equally interested in her brain and her staff.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Domination: target must save vs. spell at -4 penalty or be dominated for 1 turn<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Aura of Command: opponents within 30 feet suffer -2 penalty to saves vs. spell<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Mindbreaking: 15% chance target must save vs. spell at -4 or be feebleminded<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *STAF10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF10.png "Staff of Curing +1") | **Staff of Curing +1**<br /><br />These items are said to manifest during times of great trouble, though the entity responsible varies depending on whose followers you question. Many have begun to think the staffs a gift of the combined gods of good alignment, deities that know their faithful must struggle, and that there is always a need for a healing hand.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Healing Surge: restores 20 hit points to all allies<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Healing Aura: wielder and allies within 20 feet restore 1 hit point every 3 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *STAF11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF11.png "Staff of the Magi +5") | **Staff of the Magi +5**<br /><br />This type of staff is thoroughly linked to the image of the spellcasting profession, rare though it is. It is among the most powerful tools that a wizard can possess, the culmination of complex enchantment and endless study. With the secrets of their creation all but lost, such staffs are more often found in the hoards of ancient dragons than the hands of living wizards.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Remove Magic: dispels all magical effects upon enemies in a 30 feet radius<br /> Spell Trap: absorbs up to 30 levels of spell, making the caster recall previously cast spells<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +20% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dispelling: removes all magical effects upon the target (save vs. spell neg.)<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 +5<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By<br /> Mage|
| *STAF12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF12.png "Staff of Power +2") | **Staff of Power +2**<br /><br />Staffs of Power are immediately familiar to most spellcasters, and are almost icons of arcane study. The inherent utility of such staffs has resulted in many being crafted or commissioned, and specific histories are usually lost in the crowd.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Hold Monster: target and opponents within 5 feet must save vs. spell at -4 or be held for 1 turn<br /> Globe of Invulnerability: wielder is immune to spells of 4th level or lower for 2 turns<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +2 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 +2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By<br /> Mage|
| *STAF13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF13.png "Staff of Thunder and Lightning +2") | **Staff of Thunder and Lightning +2**<br /><br />There are stories that tell of such staves sprouting in the undergrowth around druid groves when the forest is threatened. Fanciful tales, but whether they are true or not, this staff is a powerful tool indeed. It draws energy from storms, and there is a chance that any blow may trigger a deafening thunderclap that knocks enemies down. It can also casts lightning bolts capable of paralyzing the target, and if circumstances warrant it, it can summon a lighting storm to blast enemies to dust.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Lightning Stroke: 10D6 (save vs. staff half) and stun for 1 round (save vs. staff neg.)<br /> Thunder & Lightning: each lightning bolt deals 6D6 electrical damage (save vs. staff half) and deafens for 3 rounds (no save)<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Shocking: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of electrical damage<br /> Thunderclap: 20% chance target and opponents within 5 feet must save vs. breath or be stunned for 1 round<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 +2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Druid|
| *STAF14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF14.png "Staff of the Woodlands +4") | **Staff of the Woodlands +4**<br /><br />Known only as the "Wild Man of the Wood," the man that carried this staff was a legendary figure near Trademeet until the day he died and returned to the soil. Those who saw him remember his dark, bark-like skin, and his wounds closing as soon as they were inflicted. He would harass irresponsible loggers and poachers, and old-timers tell of mercenaries chasing him with a dozen hunting dogs or more. The animals seemed ready to rip the poor druid to pieces, but he quickly turned them on their former masters. Rushing forward in hopes of a quick victory, the men-at-arms saw the final power of the staff, and as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Barkskin: wielder's skin becames as tough as bark, increasing armor class by 4<br /> Summon Shambling Mound<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Animal Empaty: animals within 30 feet must save vs. spell at -4 or be charmed<br /> Regeneration: wearer regenerates 1 hit point every round<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 +4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By<br /> Druids|
| *STAF15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF15.png "Staff of Air +2") | **Staff of Air +2**<br /><br />Legend states that a planeswalker brought this staff from his home plane, although other tales claim it was forged by an ancient druidic sect, or was the weapon of a powerful elementalist. In truth, several such staves exist. They are tied to different elemental planes, and each has had many stories from any number of owners. Perhaps that is their true power: they compel people to craft heroes of their own.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Gust of Wind: opponents within 10 feet must save vs. breath at -2 penalty or be knocked back unconscious for 1 round, gaseous clouds are dispersed<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Speed: +1 attack per round<br /> Whirlwind Strike: 20% chance of dealing 1d6 + 2 points of crushing damage to opponents within 5 feet<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF16.png "Staff of Earth +2") | **Staff of Earth +2**<br /><br />Legend states that a planeswalker brought this staff from his home plane, although other tales claim it was forged by an ancient druidic sect, or was the weapon of a powerful elementalist. In truth, several such staves exist. They are tied to different elemental planes, and each has had many stories from any number of owners. Perhaps that is their true power: they compel people to craft heroes of their own.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Earth Grasp: opponents within 30 feet from the caster must save vs. breath or be entangled for 2 rounds<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Earthshaking: 10% chance target and opponents within 5 feet must save vs. breath or fall to the ground for 1 round<br /> Stonehold: 50% chance target must save vs. petrification or be held for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF17.png "Staff of Fire +2") | **Staff of Fire +2**<br /><br />Legend states that a planeswalker brought this staff from his home plane, although other tales claim it was forged by an ancient druidic sect, or was the weapon of a powerful elementalist. In truth, several such staves exist. They are tied to different elemental planes, and each has had many stories from any number of owners. Perhaps that is their true power: they compel people to craft heroes of their own.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Fireball: 10D6 (save vs. breath at -2 half)<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Burst of Flames: 15% chance of inflicting 4D6 points of fire damage to target and opponents within 5 feet<br /> Incendiary: inflicts 2 points of fire damage each round for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF18.png "Quarterstaff +2") | **Quarterstaff +2**<br /><br />The simplest and humblest of staff weapons, the quarterstaff is a length of wood ranging six to nine feet in length. High quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends. The quarterstaff must be wielded with both hands. Powerful enchantments have improved this staff's accuracy and the damage it can cause, but they bear no signature.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF19.png "Cleric's Staff +3") | **Cleric's Staff +3**<br /><br />The faithful teach that staves like this are the will of a deity made manifest. While this is debatable, these items do tend to find their way to the hands of the truly righteous, by accident or design. Still, the number of these staffs in circulation makes the miraculous origin theory somewhat unlikely.<br /><br />Note: always considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what it can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Protection from Undead: +2 bonus to AC and saving throws vs. undead creatures<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Halt Undead: undead creatures must save vs. spell or be held for 2 rounds<br /> Undead Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +8 to damage against undead<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *STAF20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF20.png "Staff of Rynn +3") | **Staff of Rynn +3**<br /><br />There was a time when magic was distrusted even more so than now, and the burning of "heretics" was woefully common. Delmarey, a witch from the swamplands near Myth Rynn, faced just such a fate when she was blamed for an unseasonable drought. Taken by surprise and sentenced by a mob, she was put to the torch in the village square. With her dying breath she uttered a foul curse, fueling the fire to an unstoppable magnitude. By dawn, the entire village was reduced to black coal, save the burnt remains of the pole Delmarey had been bound to. This staff has been imbued with some remnants of Delmarey's power, making it a highly enchanted weapon.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Greater Malison<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Hexproof: wielder is immune to hostile hexes and curses such as Doom, Malison, Symbols, Polymorph or similar effects<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Horrifying: target must save vs. spell or flee in terror for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage|
| *STAF21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF21.png "Staff of the Ram +4") | **Staff of the Ram +4**<br /><br />Likely created by the same unknown archmage responsible for the Ring of the Ram, this cudgel resembles a Staff of Striking, but attacking with it doesn't consume its magical energy and it will never become useless.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Striking: creatures struck suffer 6 additional points of crushing damage<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF22.png "Staff of the Ram +5") | **Staff of the Ram +5**<br /><br />Likely created by the same unknown archmage responsible for the Ring of the Ram, this cudgel resembles a Staff of Striking, but its attacks are even more devastating and don't consume the staff's magical energy.<br /><br />Combining this staff with the Ring of the Ram's magic augmented its already noteworthy abilities, creating a weapon few opponents are able to stand against.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Battering Ram: target must save vs. death or be knocked back unconscious for 1 round and suffer 2d6 additional points of damage<br /> Striking: creatures struck suffer 6 additional points of crushing damage<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 5<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/STAF23.png "Serpent Shaft +3") | **Serpent Shaft +3**<br /><br />Adorned with serpentine designs, this powerful quarterstaff has a chance to release a lethal toxin against its opponents with every blow.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Venomous: creatures struck suffer 1D6 points of additional poison damage<br /> Viperous: 15% chance to inject a lethal poison which inflicts 10 points of damage every second for 2 rounds unless a save vs. poison at -4 penalty is made<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
