It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiates when assembled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity with magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities (20% chance each):<br /> Cold Head: 1D3 additional cold damage, slow target for 3 rounds<br /> Fire Head: 1D3 additional fire damage, -2 penalty to THAC0 for 3 rounds<br /> Acid Head: 1D3 additional acid damage, -2 penalty to AC for 3 rounds<br /><br />Note: targets can save vs. spell to avoid the secondary effects but will still suffer elemental damage.<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Flail/Morning Star<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|

| *DWBLUN01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWBLUN01.png "Drowcraft Flail +3") | **Drowcraft Flail +3**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft weapon is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wielder exceptional accuracy. Drowcraft weapons will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: +2 luck bonus to minimum damage and attack rolls<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Flail/Morning Star<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *WAFLAIL*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAFLAIL.png "Defender of Easthaven +2") | **Defender of Easthaven +2**<br /><br />Flurry's End<br />This flail was created a century ago to commemorate the defeat of the demon Belhifet. It was meant to remain within the town of Easthaven to remind the people of the great evil that had barely been defeated, but it was stolen, only to reappear years later on the northernmost reaches of the Sword Coast, in the City of Sails.<br /><br />For a brief but bloody time, the fighting pits of Luskan were home to a particularly vicious halfling who called herself "Flurry." Though her opponents were swift to underestimate her, they were quickly surprised by the speed of her attacks and the effectiveness of her strikes. As her reputation grew, Flurry grew reckless, allowing her opponents one free hit on her small frame - showing off to the crowd that she seemed to be unharmed by the blow - before viciously bludgeoning her opponent to death. In the end, it was Flurry's own ego that did her in: in a match where her speed and cunning could have bested her adversary easily, the free hit she allowed him with his scythe proved to be more effective than she had planned, and send her head tumbling into the dust.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Armor Class: +1 bonus<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +10 bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Cleaving: with each successful hit there's a 20% chance of gaining one extra attack in the next round<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Flail/Morning Star<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *DVFLAIL*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DVFLAIL.png "Flail of Submission +2") | **Flail of Submission +2**<br /><br />Once wielded by the most feared of Thayan slavemasters, the Flail of Submission was used to discipline only the most dangerous of slaves. Though often other slavers warned of keeping such a powerful weapon in such close proximity to those it was meant to dominate, the warning was not heeded until a yound slave named Zarine managed to woo it from a careless master's hand, allowing her to slay him with it and escape. The Red Wizards themselves demanded ownership of the weapon after that, fearing what might have become had Zarine taken the weapon with her... or had attempted to free more slaves with it as well.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Domineering: 50% chance target must save vs. spell or suffer -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class for 5 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Flail/Morning Star<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
