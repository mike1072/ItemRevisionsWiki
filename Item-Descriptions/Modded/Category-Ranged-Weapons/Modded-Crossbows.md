| *DWXBOW01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWXBOW01.png "Drowcraft Light Crossbow of Speed +1") | **Drowcraft Light Crossbow of Speed +1**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft weapon is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wielder exceptional accuracy. Drowcraft weapons will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Rapid Reload: +1 attack per round<br /> Drowcraft: +2 luck bonus to minimum damage and attack rolls<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Crossbow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Cavalier<br /> Kensai<br /> Monk|

Never knowing the names of their extinct benefactors, the colonists used these "tools" to carve a large territory for themselves, though in the end it was for naught. Crushed by a superior number of hobgoblins, these unfortunate souls have joined the ancients in anonymity.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Rapid Reload: +1 attack per round<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Crossbow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

So feared were they, it was said that their victims were, for all practical purposes, dead from the moment the Dying Light accepted the contract to end their lives. Though this crossbow and its owner's fame remain, the Dying Light is but a memory, its membership having succumbed to Time, the ultimate assassin.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Hide In Shadows: +20% bonus<br /> Move Silently: +20% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Sharpshoot: 25% chance the user remains invisible for 1 round after an attack, also gaining +4 bonus to the next attack roll<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: +2 bonus<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Crossbow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

Arioth had lived in a small community near the edge of Anauroch, the great desert. When a mysterious force emerged from the sands to destroy the village, Arioth's wife was killed. Through circumstance, Arioth became a wandering mercenary. Over time, Arioth became a great hero and champion for the innocents of Cormyr and the Dalelands, though he shied away from such praise. His worn, light crossbow was probably the secret of his many successes, though how he came in possession of such a powerful tool is not known. When Arioth died of old age, his wishes were that his equipment be sold off at an auction in Essembra, Battledale, and the proceeds given to the citizens of that village.<br /><br />One of the most powerful crossbows in the realms, Firetooth has no need for ammunition, as it automatically launches magical bolts of fire.<br /><br />Note: requires no ammunition, but normal bolts cannot be fired with this crossbow. Fire Bolts are considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what they can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Fire Bolts: inflict additional 2D4 points of fire damage (save vs. breath half)<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 4<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Crossbow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

Scant few of these weapons survive to this day, mainly due to the eventual annihilation of the king's forces by a coalition of subjugated lands.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Accuracy: additional +3 to attack rolls, and +10% chance to score critical hits<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: +3 bonus<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 9<br />Proficiency Type: Crossbow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
