| *SLNG01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG01.png "Sling") | **Sling**<br /><br />Slings have existed since the beginning of recorded history. The basic sling consists of a leather or fabric strap with a pouch for holding the missile. The weapon is held by both ends of the strap and twirled around the wielder's head. When top speed is attained, the missile is launched by releasing one of the strap's ends.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG02.png "Sling +1") | **Sling +1**<br /><br />Slings have existed since the beginning of recorded history. The basic sling consists of a leather or fabric strap with a pouch for holding the missile. The weapon is held by both ends of the strap and twirled around the wielder's head. When top speed is attained, the missile is launched by releasing one of the strap's ends. This particular sling is enchanted.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG03.png "Sling of Seeking +1") | **Sling of Seeking +1**<br /><br />The gnomes who invented this device weren't known for courage, but their tale was heroic just the same. Defending their home against bugbear invaders, the gnomes hurriedly invented a set of slings so accurate they could be fired behind the wielder's back. So prepared, the gnomes taunted their attackers into a chase, and rained stones on them over their shoulders. Though many bugbears were killed, the gnomes were eventually caught and the village destroyed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Seeking: additional +6 to attack rolls<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG04.png "Sling +2") | **Sling +2**<br /><br />Magical slings are the hallmark of stout halfling warriors. Usually their mothers or a talented aunt will create such a sling for the halfling lad or lass who is about to embark on their second great adventure. The reason that the sling is given on the second adventure and not the first is that many halflings decide not to pursue the life of an adventurer after getting a taste of it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: +2 bonus<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG05.png "Arla's Dragonbane +3") | **Arla's Dragonbane +3**<br /><br />None know better than halflings the value of a well-placed stone when confronting a larger foe. This particular weapon was the property of a young woman named Arla Surestep, one of the few small-folk that left the hearth to seek adventure. Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for a more humorous than lethal effect. It would seem that halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to history.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Movement Rate: +1 bonus<br /> Saving Throws: +3 vs. breath<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dragon Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +6 to damage against dragons<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG06.png "Sling of Arvoreen +2") | **Sling of Arvoreen +2**<br /><br />This sling is blessed by the halfling god Arvoreen. The weapon was gifted to the heroic Tuckerby Lettleworp after the Battle of Moor Road, in which an invading army of Yuan-ti were slain by Lettleworp's forces, saving his halfling village. Thought at first to be a unique item, there have actually been a number of these items found. In fact, much like the tales of Littleman, it would seem that nearly every halfling village has a similar story about the acquisition of such an item. What this means regarding their true origins is unknown.<br />The sling has the ability to rend the senses of the wielder's enemies with a wall of sound said to be the voice of the god himself.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Sonic Blast: 15% chance to blast an area of 10 feet radius with a tremendous sonic wave, dealing 4d4 points of damage to opponents within it, and stunning them for 1 round unless a save vs. spell is made<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: +2 bonus<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG07.png "Sling of Force +2") | **Sling of Force +2**<br /><br />The gnomes who invented this device based its design on one they supposedly saw a fire giant use, reportedly "big enough to throw a donkey 300 paces." Questioning the accuracy of this account brings the predictable retort that "you'll be sorry when a giant puts YOUR ass in a sling."<br />Unlike most other slings, the Sling of Force is capable of throwing stones and allowing a strength bonus to be applied to the damage it inflicts. Although the sling is magical, giving it a bonus to hit and to damage, it is also capable of inflicting strength damage due to its design, and not due to enchantment.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Strength bonus is applied to damage<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: +2 bonus<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG08.png "Erinne Sling +3") | **Erinne Sling +3**<br /><br />The gnomish village of Erinne was long protected by a single guardian, armed only with a magical sling created by the sorceress for which the town was named. When the village was overrun by orcs, the sling disappeared.<br />This legendary sling has no need for ammunition, as it automatically launches bullets of magical energy.<br /><br />Note: requires no ammunition, but normal bullets cannot be fired with this sling. Energy Bullets are considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what they can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Energy Bullet: deals 1D4 additional points of magic damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 4<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG09.png "Erinne Sling +4") | **Erinne Sling +4**<br /><br />The gnomish village of Erinne was long protected by a single guardian, armed only with a magical sling created by the sorceress for which the town was named. When the village was overrun by orcs, the sling disappeared. This outstanding sling is capable of infusing any projectile fired by it with magical energy, though how it does it remains a mystery.<br /><br />The modifications to the Erinne sling have made significant improvements to its already impressive enchantments. The magical bullets fired from it can now burst upon impact releasing a massive energy blast so forceful that it can potentially disintegrate the target hit.<br /><br />Note: requires no ammunition, but normal bullets cannot be fired with this sling. Energy Bullets are considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what they can hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Energy Bullet: deals 1D4 additional points of magic damage<br /> Energy Burst: 10% chance target must save vs. spell at -4 penalty or take 100 points of magic damage<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 5<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *SLNG10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SLNG10.png "Sling +3") | **Sling +3**<br /><br />Magical slings are the hallmark of stout halfling warriors.
