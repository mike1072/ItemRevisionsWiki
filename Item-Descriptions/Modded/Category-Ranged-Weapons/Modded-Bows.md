| *BOW05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW05.png "Short Bow") | **Short Bow**<br /><br />Short bows were the first bows to be developed, although they were not called such. 'Short bow' is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a long bow. Short bow staves are about 5 feet long on average. As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges, either by giving them longer staves or by increasing flexibility with no change to the length. The former resulted in what is now called the long bow.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

'Short bow' is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a long bow. Short bow staves are about 5 feet long on average. As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges, either by giving them longer staves or by increasing flexibility with no change to the length.

| *BOW08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW08.png "Eagle Bow +2") | **Eagle Bow +2**<br /><br />Protector of the Dryads<br />In order to protect their community from an encroaching orc logging encampment, the hero Hannable the White was given this magnificent bow by the dryads of Gulthmere Forest. A deadly confrontation followed when the loggers dared try to cut down a great oak tree, nearly killing the dryad linked to it. With the help of powerful forest animals, Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood. The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest. Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily . . . nay, VERY happily ever after!<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Entangling: 50% chance target must save vs. breath or be entangled for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *BOW14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW14.png "Tuigan Bow +1") | **Tuigan Bow +1**<br /><br />The Tuigans are a nomadic people widely dispersed across the steppe regions of Faerun, but bound together by a common bloodline. The bows they make are especially tailored for their mobile warriors, and the process used is carefully guarded, but the result is well known: any bow of Tuigan origin can be fired faster than is possible with a normal one.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Rapid Shot: +1 attack per round<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *BOW15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW15.png "Tansheron's Bow +3") | **Tansheron's Bow +3**<br /><br />The thin, frayed string of this bow appears unusable, but when it is drawn a solid but invisible arrow becomes tangible. The lich Tansheron gave this bow to his Watcher, the guardian of his keep who stood atop a tower with neither entrance nor exit. When anyone approached, down would fall a never-ending rain of phantom arrows until they died or fled. How this bow was wrested from the Watcher's hand is not known, but would probably make a great tavern story.<br /><br />Note: requires no ammunition, but normal arrows cannot be fired with this bow. Phantom Arrows are considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what they can hit<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Phantom Arrow: 20% chance target must save vs. spell or flee in terror for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6<br />Damage type: missile<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges, either by giving them longer staves or by increasing flexibility with no change to the length. The former resulted in what is now called the long bow. This particular bow rivals any of its larger cousins: the magic inherent within it, whether a property of the wood itself or the result of a mage's enchantment, makes it more accurate than a normal bow.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

It is said that Gesen was prepared to retire from his craft after selling the invaluable weapon, only to have the bow wrested from his grasp by a thief who used it to end Gesen's own life.<br /><br />Closer examination reveals that the bow is made of iron, cunningly wrought to appear like wood, while the string is a golden wire. Although it looks heavy and impossible to use the bow is quite light and can be drawn back with ease, bending more than iron should allow.<br /><br />Note: requires no ammunition, but normal arrows cannot be fired with this bow. Lightning Spears are considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what they can hit<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Lightning Spear: inflicts additional 2D6 points of electrical damage (save vs. breath half)<br /><br />THAC0: +4<br />Damage: 1D8<br />Damage type: missile<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

| *CATTIBOW*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/CATTIBOW.png "Taulmaril +3") | **Taulmaril +3**<br /><br />A gift from Lady Anariel to Clan Battlehammer, this beautifully crafted force elven bow is made of polished wood. Arrows fired from this bow emit a powerful jolt of magical force which deals additional force damage on a successful hit. If the arrow strikes a target protected by a force effect, such as a Shield spell, it dispels the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Cattie-brie's Quiver of Anariel grants to Taulmaril an infinite amount of highly enchanted ammos.<br /><br />Note: requires no ammunition, but normal arrows cannot be fired with this bow. Quiver of Anariel's arrows are considered to be of +3 enchantment when determining what they can hit<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Elvencraft: +4 bonus to AC (none vs. missile)<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Infuse Energy: deals 1D6 additional points of magic damage<br /> Pierce Force Shield: dispels Mage Armor, Shield and Armor of Faith spells on hit<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1d6<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br />Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

| *BOW03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW03.png "Long Bow") | **Long Bow**<br /><br />The long bow is similar to the short bow, except that the staff is about as high as the archer is, usually 6 to 6.5 feet. Though the long bow is slightly slower than the short bow, it has better range and is more damaging.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

Though the long bow is slightly slower than the short bow, it has better range and is more accurate.

| *BOW07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW07.png "Long Bow of Marksmanship +2") | **Long Bow of Marksmanship +2**<br /><br />The Dead Shot<br />Driven by years of rivalry, the Dukes of Spandeliyon and Delthuntle decided to organize a private contest that would proclaim the better archer between them. Both boasted the power of their magical bows, but that wasn't enough for Edwall Dest, Duke of Spandeliyon. He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest he couldn't help gloating about his advantage. The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed. Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Marksmanship: +10% chance to score critical hits<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *BOW12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW12.png "Elven Court Bow +3") | **Elven Court Bow +3**<br /><br />This yew bow seems more a work of art than a weapon of war; fine engravings dance over the polished wood, and the bowstring gleams of gold, almost singing when drawn. Once thought a unique and singular example of elven craftmanship, this theory was discarded when a group of adventurers discovered half a dozen identical bows in the ruin of Myth Drannor. Though highly decorated, elf crafters also gave the bow metal inlays which gives the wielder the option to fend off attacks without sacrificing rate of fire and accuracy.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Elvencraft: +4 bonus to armor class vs. melee attacks<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

He was tireless in bringing to justice those who unlawfully used magic. The bow served him well in his cause, especially when hunting down those who tried to escape with the help of the deceptive illusionary arts.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +10% bonus<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Illusion Bane: 20% chance to dispel illusionary protections and creatures<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

Though the long bow is slightly slower than the short bow, it has better range and is more accurate. The smooth staff of this bow is warm to the touch, hinting at the energy which surges through the wood.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

| *BOW01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW01.png "Composite Long Bow") | **Composite Long Bow**<br /><br />Composite bows are long bows or short bows whose staves are made from more than one type of material. This gives greater flexibility, and makes arrows fired from such bows deliver more damage. Wielding such a powerful bow requires great strength.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 16 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Bard<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|

| *BOW09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW09.png "Ripper +2") | **Ripper +2**<br /><br />This composite longbow was one of many made by a half-elven craftsman whose name has been lost to history. At one time there were several hundred in use, favored by scouts who patrolled the Anauroch desert, but many have been lost or destroyed. Only a few are still known to exist, but they see little use due to the high strength they require, and they rarely find their way to the open market.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Sundering: each hit reduces target's armor class by 1 for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Requires: 18 Strength<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Bard<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *BOW10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW10.png "Heartseeker +3") | **Heartseeker +3**<br /><br />Legends say that craftsman Pinn O'Reffen fashioned this bow from the heart of a Treant, though how he came to possess such material is unknown. He certainly did not anticipate the enchantment within, magic that makes the archer's aim almost infallible, and the arrows it fires strike directly at the target's heart (if it has one), potentially slaying the victim instantly. Pinn claimed his skill was responsible, but it is more likely that some aspect of the soul of the Treant is still within the wood.<br /><br />Note: certain creatures (such as elementals, golems, and undead) do not have hearts, and are not affected by this weapon's ability.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Seeking: additional +3 to attack rolls<br /> Heartseeking: 10% chance target must save vs. death or die<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 16 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Bard<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *BOW11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW11.png "Strong Arm +2") | **Strong Arm +2**<br /><br />This massive bow was the property of the ranger Bearpaw, who reportedly received it from a strangely benevolent ogre. The reason for the gift was never discussed, but he earned the respect of everyone he met, and likely befriended the creature while patrolling the Cloakwood Forest. Bearpaw could draw back the bowstring without the slightest effort, but when he died it was bequeathed to his wife and sons, and not a one could draw the string even halfway. They eventually sold it to a merchant heading south.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: +6 bonus<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 19 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Bard<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
| *BOW16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/BOW16.png "Composite Long Bow +2") | **Composite Long Bow +2**<br /><br />This long bow is marked with the seal of a sunburst. It was probably once used by guards in the service of the god Amaunator. These guards would use enchanted bows to keep the priests of that long dead faith safe. Few of these bows still exist, so they are sought after by many archers looking to improve both their accuracy and their lethality. This bow requires a strength of 16 to use.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 16 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Bard<br /> Monk<br /> Kensai<br /> Cavalier|
