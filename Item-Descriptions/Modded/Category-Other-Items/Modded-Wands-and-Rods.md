| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *WAND02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND02.png "Wand of Fear") | **Wand of Fear**<br /><br />A Wand of Fear strikes terror into the heart of the target and any creature within 20 foot radius. Opponents within the area must save vs. wand at -1 penalty or flee in terror for 5 rounds. This panic is not universal, however, as the stout of heart have been known to resist its magic. Like all wands, the Wand of Fear can only be used a limited number of times before it is destroyed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Fear<br /><br />Requires: 11 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND03.png "Wand of Magic Missiles") | **Wand of Magic Missiles**<br /><br />When activated, this wand will eject three missiles of magical energy that dart forth and unerringly strike its target, which must be visible to be hit. Each missile will inflict 1D4 + 1 points of magic damage. Almost anyone of moderate intelligence can learn how to use this wand.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Magic Missile<br /><br />Requires: 10 Intelligence<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *WAND04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND04.png "Wand of Paralyzation") | **Wand of Paralyzation**<br /><br />When used, this wand shoots forth a thin ray of bluish color to a maximum range of 60 feet. When a creature is touched by the ray, it must save vs. wands at a -4 penalty in order to avoid being stunned for 10 rounds. As with other wands, the Wand of Paralyzation has a limited number of uses. Once these have been expended, it shatters.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Paralyzation<br /><br />Requires: 14 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND05.png "Wand of Fire") | **Wand of Fire**<br /><br />When used, this wand will cough forth a huge, burning ball of fire that streaks out to the desired range (a maximum of 90 feet) and bursts in a fiery, violent blast of 30ft radius. Creatures within the area take 6d6 points of fire damage, those who successfully save vs. wands at -2 penalty take only half damage.<br />The second ability of the wand is akin to the wizard spell 'Agannazar's Scorcher' in that a column of flame will streak towards a victim, inflicting 5d6 points of fire damage to everyone in his path. The victim(s) may make a save vs. wands at -1 in order to reduce the damage dealt by half.<br />Like all wands, the Wand of Fire can only be used a limited number of times. Once these have been expended, it dissolves into a pile of ash.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consume charges):<br /> Fireball<br /> Scorching Ray<br /><br />Requires: 12 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND06.png "Wand of Frost") | **Wand of Frost**<br /><br />A Wand of Frost acts in a similar fashion to the Cone of Cold spell. Crystallized particles of snow and ice fan out from the wand's tip, defining an area wherein the temperature drops to -100 degrees F. When used, white crystalline motes spray forth from the wand in a column towards the victim, striking him or her square in the chest with numbing force. The temperature inside the column is deadly, and causes 6d6 points of cold damage, and slows the target for 5 rounds. A successful save vs. wands at -3 penalty reduces the damage by half. Like all wands, the Wand of Frost can only be used a limited number of times before it melts into a harmless pool of water.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consume charges):<br /> Freezing Sphere<br /><br />Requires: 13 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND07.png "Wand of Lightning") | **Wand of Lightning**<br /><br />A Wand of Lightning causes bolts of electrical energy to be discharged from its tip to strike at specified opponents. The possessor of the wand can discharge three bolts of lightning, and may target up to three different enemies. Each bolt does 3D6 points of electrical damage, with a save vs. wand at -3 penalty for half damage. Like all wands, the Wand of Lightning has a limited number of uses. Once these have been expended, the wand is reduced to little more than a chunk of scarred and twisted metal.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Three Lightning bolts<br /><br />Requires: 13 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND08.png "Wand of Sleep") | **Wand of Sleep**<br /><br />When used, this wand emits a gold beam of energy at its targets up to a maximum range of 90 feet, affecting a 30 foot cube. If the target creatures fail their save vs. wands, they will fall into a deep, comatose sleep for 1 turn. Creatures with more than 10 Hit Dice/Levels are unaffected. Almost anyone of moderate intelligence can learn how to use this wand. As with other wands, the Wand of Sleep dissolves after a limited number of uses.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Sleep<br /><br />Requires: 10 Intelligence<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *WAND09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND09.png "Wand of Polymorphing") | **Wand of Polymorphing**<br /><br />When used, this wand emits a thin, green beam that darts forth to a nearby target. Any creature touched by this beam must make a save vs. wands at -3 penalty or be polymorphed into a squirrel.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Polymorph<br /><br />Requires: 13 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage|
| *WAND10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND10.png "Wand of Monster Summoning") | **Wand of Monster Summoning**<br /><br />A Wand of Monster Summoning teleports an array of monsters to the wielder's side, placing them under his or her complete control. As the controller wearies from this exertion, the monsters slowly disappear. This wand will summon 12 HD of monsters, which appear within the area of effect and attack the user's enemies. They remain until the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain. These creatures vanish when slain. If no opponent exists to fight and the wizard can communicate with them, the summoned monsters can perform other services for the summoning wizard. As with other wands, the Wand of Monster Summoning can only be used a limited number of times before crumbling into a pile of dust.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Summon 12 HD of monsters<br /><br />Requires: 14 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND11.png "Wand of the Heavens") | **Wand of the Heavens**<br /><br />When used, this wand will cause a pillar of flame to shoot from the sky and strike the target of the invoker. The flames will do 9d6 points of fire damage to the target unless the target makes a save vs. wands at -3 penalty, in which case it will take half damage. The wand has a limited amount of charges, and will be destroyed when they are all used.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consume charges):<br /> Column of Fire<br /><br />Requires: 9 Intelligence, 13 Wisdom<br />Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid|
| *WAND13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND13.png "Wand of Cloudkill") | **Wand of Cloudkill**<br /><br />This wand emits a vapor bubble that travels towards the target exploding into a deadly cloud of noxious gas that expands to fill an area roughly 20 feet in radius. The cloud will instantly kill any creature with 4 HD or less with no saving throw. Any creature within 5 to 6 HD must make a saving throw vs wands at -4 penalty or be slain. Creatures with greater than 6 HD simply take 1-10 poison damage for every round that they remain within the cloud. The cloud will dissipate after approximately 1 turn.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Cloudkill<br /><br />Requires: 14 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND14.png "Web Sack") | **Web Sack**<br /><br />When used, this wand shoots forth many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. They cover an area of about 20 feet in radius, and creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Each round that a creature remains in the web, he must make a saving throw vs. breath or be unable to move. The webs will dissipate after approximately 1 turn.<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Web<br /><br />Requires: 11 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND15.png "Wand of the Apprenti") | **Wand of the Apprenti**<br /><br />This wand was created for you by your apprentices, and will randomly cast a variety of three spells, each from a separate elemental source.  It apparently has 50 charges.<br /><br />Requires: 9 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *WAND18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND18.png "Wand of Spell Striking") | **Wand of Spell Striking**<br /><br />Ironically, these wands are both prized and hated by wizards. They can tear down an enemy mage's defenses, but of course every mage knows the wands can also be turned against themselves.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consume charges):<br /> Breach<br /> Pierce Magic<br /><br />Requires: 15 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Bard|
| *WAND19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND19.png "Wand of Cursing") | **Wand of Cursing**<br /><br />This wand instantly afflicts targets with blindness and deafness, and renders them mute for 1 turn unless a successful save vs. wands at -2 penalty is made. But perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this terrible device is that almost anyone can use it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consume charges):<br /> Blindness, Deafness and Silence<br /><br />Requires: 12 Intelligence<br />Usable By:<br /> All|

# Modded Rods
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *RODS01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RODS01.png "Rod of Absorption") | **Rod of Absorption**<br /><br />This rod acts as a magnet, drawing magic spells of any nature (priest or wizard) into itself. It then nullifies their effects. The magic absorbed must have been directed at the character possessing the rod. Activating this absorption ability takes an instant and the user will be protected for one round or until the absorption disappears. The rod will absorb nine levels of spells and can defend against spells up to ninth level in power.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (twice per day):<br /> Spell Absorption<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage|
| *RODS02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RODS02.png "Rod of Lordly Might") | **Rod of Lordly Might**<br /><br />Also called The Wrath of Three Kings, though not associated with any named king in particular, this rod was likely made in 1090DR.  It saw use during The Battle of the Bones, but for which side is uncertain as it was found amongst the dead after a larger skirmish.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (once per day):<br /> Paralyze: a target within 30 feet must save vs. rod at -2 penalty or be paralyzed for 5 rounds<br /> Fear: opponents within 20 feet must save vs. rod or flee in terror<br /> Life Drain: drains 10 hit points from a target and transfers it to the wielder<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RODS03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RODS03.png "Rod of Resurrection") | **Rod of Resurrection**<br /><br />This rod enables anyone to resurrect the dead as if they were a priest of high enough level. No rest is required, as the rod bestows the life giving effects, but each use of the rod expends one charge. With the power to restore life itself, these rods are extremely prized. It is not known if this particular example was created to aid in the good works of a saint or prolong the ills of an overlord, for such rods serve indiscriminately.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (twice per day):<br /> Raise Dead<br /><br />Requires: 11 Wisdom<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *RODS04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RODS04.png "Rod of Smiting +4") | **Rod of Smiting +4**<br /><br />Rods of Smiting are extremely uncommon weapons, though they can be very useful against some foes. This particular rod was last in the possession of a priest of Gond named Debian of Urmlaspyr. Debian was an eccentric adventurer, who took it upon himself to investigate every type of golem that had been reported in the realms. In many cases, the creator of the golem would send his or her creations after Debian for his snooping. Debian usually escaped without much personal harm. Unfortunately for Debian, his luck ran out when he investigated the lair of the Machinery Man, a bizarre lich who happened to be the creator of golems and other animated constructs. The Machinery Man's lab full of iron golems proved to be too much for Debian to overcome.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Shattering: golems must save vs. polymorph or be destroyed<br /> Golem Bane: additional +2 bonus to THAC0 and +6 to damage against golems<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *RODS05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RODS05.png "Rod of Terror") | **Rod of Terror**<br /><br />These twisted rods emanate an aura of evil even while inactive, and fill all who gaze upon them with unease. They are capable of projecting a wave of unspeakable horror upon a single foe, filling even the hardiest soul with acute dread, and were certainly created for nefarious use.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Charisma: -2 penalty<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Fearsome: 33% chance target must save vs. spell or flee in terror for 2 rounds<br /><br />Thac0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Club<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *RODS06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/RODS06.png "Rod of Reversal") | **Rod of Reversal**<br /><br />These powerful items allow a wielder to quickly dispel the magic of friend or foe alike. Those who hunt spellcasters particularly prize them, although casters themselves are also quick to snatch them up on the open market.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (twice per day):<br /> Reverse Magic: removes all magical effects upon the target unless a save vs. rod at -4 penalty is made<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
| *WAND12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/WAND12.png "Rod of Wonder") | **Rod of Wonder**<br /><br />Only those with a gambling streak dare use this rod in battle. When triggered, it is at best unpredictable, and at worst, suicidal. The whimsical mage Malimak created it as a gift for a rival, though more as a prank than with hurtful intent. The recipient's reaction is not known, though Malimak relocated shortly thereafter. It should be used with caution, or not at all. Almost any class of character of moderate intelligence can learn how to use this rod.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (consumes charges):<br /> Random effects<br /><br />Requires: 10 Intelligence<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Wizard Slayer|
