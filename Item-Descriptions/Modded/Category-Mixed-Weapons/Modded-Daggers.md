| *DAGG10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG10.png "Soultaker Dagger") | **Soultaker Dagger**<br /><br />This dagger weighs heavily in your hand, and is warm to the touch. Merely having it on your person makes you feel uneasy for some reason. The gem mounted in the hilt seems to have an inner light of some sort, though how it can have such illumination and still be so deathly black at its core, you do not know.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D4 <br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 2 <br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|

During his travels, he ended up staying with a family of dwarven weaponsmiths.

| *DAGG12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG12.png "Dragon Tooth +3") | **Dragon Tooth +3**<br /><br />This throwing knife is imbued with magical fire, and was supposedly carved from a red dragon's tooth. Tavern tales suggest that the beast is still alive, her anger fueling the enchantment within the weapon. Though fanciful, the story is consistent, and it is said the dagger returns to the thrower "as though on wings."<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Returning: returns to the wielder's hand instantly after an attack is made<br /> Flaming: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of fire damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 3<br />Damage type (melee): piercing<br />Damage type (thrown): missile<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|

| *DAGG13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG13.png "Pixie Prick +2") | **Pixie Prick +2**<br /><br />The Pixie Prick almost appears to be a toy, so fine and delicate is the workmanship of the blade and handle. Yet when the command word 'Sleep' is intoned, the tiny dagger glows with a blue nimbus. Upon striking an opponent the Pixie Prick releases a surge of powerful magic, potentially inducing a deep slumber, and can toss into the air a small amount of pixie dust sufficient to conceal the wielder. Legends say that the ancient sprite knight, Alfonso de Noble, wielded the Pixie Prick not as a dagger but as a two-handed sword.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Pixie Dust: 20% chance of making the user invisible for 4 rounds<br /> Sleep: 20% chance target must save vs. spell or fall asleep for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|
| *DAGG14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG14.png "Spider Fang +3") | **Spider Fang +3**<br /><br />The creation of spider fangs is known to involve the ichor and web silk of driders or certain monstrous types of spiders, and a complicated brew of strange ingredients in which the blade must be submerged for several days. This specimen in particular was forged by an unfortunate duergar smith centuries earlier, the handle was carved from a tooth of a black dragon and the blade was tempered in the blood of its creator.<br />Blades such as this are often gifts to capable assassins in the service of Lolth, which typically use the weapon to seal a target in a cocoon of silk, stepping away from their thrashing foes to complete the murder with a poisoned dart or wrist-crossbow bolt. How it has made its way to you is anyone's guess.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Acidic: creatures struck suffer 1D3 additional points of acid damage<br /> Web: 33% chance target must save vs. breath or be held for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|
| *DAGG15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG15.png "Dagger +2") | **Dagger +2**<br /><br />The typical dagger has a pointed, double-edged blade, as opposed to a knife, which has a single edge and is a bit shorter.

| *DAGG16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG16.png "Poisoned Throwing Dagger") | **Poisoned Throwing Dagger**<br /><br />The typical throwing dagger has a pointed, usually double-edged blade, as opposed to a knife, which has a single edge and is a bit shorter than the dagger. Unlike a dagger, this one has a smaller handle and is balanced perfectly. A thin coating of poison has been applied to each poisoned throwing dagger, making it a lethal tool in the hands of trained assassins.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Envenomed: creatures struck by the weapon must save vs. poison or suffer 2 point of damage each second for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4<br />Damage type: missile<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|
| *DAGG17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG17.png "Stiletto of Demarchess +2") | **Stiletto of Demarchess +2**<br /><br />Most who take up the trade of murder for hire do so for reasons other than personal pleasure, but not so the Lady Demarche. She took special pleasure in the torture of her targets...which is why she made this dagger. With but one touch of its polished blade an opponent was rendered immobile, incapable of so much as screaming, yet the victim could watch and feel all that happened to them. While her opponent was thus held, the Lady would slowly bleed them, sometimes taking several hours before allowing her subject to succumb to the final agony of death. The Lady finally fell victim to her own evil; disarmed by a rival and struck by her own Stiletto her fate was soon sealed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Wounding: target suffer 1 point of bleeding damage every round for 2 rounds<br /> Paralyzing: 20% chance target must save vs. paralyze or be held for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|
| *DAGG18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG18.png "Shadow Thief Dagger") | **Shadow Thief Dagger**<br /><br />This is the typical dagger used by Shadow Thieves of Amn. The organization known as the Shadow Thieves is the largest and most prosperous thieves' guild in all of the region. Its success is derived from its system of interlocking guilds, each dedicated to the twin goals of profit and power. From the organization's stronghold in Amn, this series of guilds controls the lion's share of all criminal operations along the Sword Coast and beyond. As a member of a Shadow Thieves' guild, a shadow thief of Amn knows only their own minions, their coworkers, and their superior. This web of secrecy preserves the organization, because any members who are captured can sell out only a few others.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D4<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|

| *DAGG21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG21.png "Dagger of the Star +4") | **Dagger of the Star +4**<br /><br />Rumored to have been dropped from the Heavens by a careless lesser deity, this dagger is made of starmetal, an extremely rare and precious ore infused with mighty magical power. Fallen stars are the only known source of starmetal, and this superior alloy made from meteoric iron is extraordinarily hard, equaling adamantite for all purposes. Starmetal also possesses an inherent magical connection to the Material Plane, meaning that weapons made of this alloy are especially effective against creatures from other planes.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Stardust: 20% chance of blinding every opponent within 5 feet for 4 rounds unless they successfully save vs. breath at -4<br /> Starmetal: deals additional 4 points of damage to extraplanar creatures<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 4<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Beast Master|

| *DAGG23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DAGG23.png "Ixil's Spike +3") | **Ixil's Spike +3**<br /><br />This "dagger" is actually the tip of Ixil's Nail - an artifact of almost unimaginable power.
