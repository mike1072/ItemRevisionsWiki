| *HAMM01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM01.png "War Hammer") | **War Hammer**<br /><br />Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of this -- the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is a descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs. The shaft is about 18 inches long.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D4 + 1<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HAMM02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM02.png "War Hammer +1") | **War Hammer +1**<br /><br />Like others of its type, this war hammer is made entirely of steel, with a bone-crushing hammer mounted upon an 18" shaft. This warhammer is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HAMM03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM03.png "Rift Hammer +2") | **Rift Hammer +2**<br /><br />During the Time of Troubles the walls between dimensions seemed particularly thin, and many creatures normally confined to other planes walked the face of Toril. Unfamiliar items appeared as well, including several of these weapons found after portals or rifts were sighted. The true origins of the Rift Hammers have never been explained, and superstitious folk refuse even to hold them for fear they retain the taint of the lower planes.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Resonating: 15% chance to unleash a crushing sonic wave, dealing 4d4 points of damage to opponents within 10 feet<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HAMM04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM04.png "Hammer of Corrosion +1") | **Hammer of Corrosion +1**<br /><br />The Hammer of Corrosion, or "The Defiler", as it has become known in dwarven circles, is a fearsome weapon capable of making useless even the most powerful armors in the Realms. Its deadly acid can corrode pratically everything it touches and consecutive blows can rend plate mails and natural armors apart leaving the victim defenceless. The hammer has been passed from heroes to villains alike, occasionally finding its way into non-dwarven hands.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Acidic: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of acid damage<br /> Corrosive: 50% chance to reduce target's armor class by 1 for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 2<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HAMM05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM05.png "Wrath of Tyr +2") | **Wrath of Tyr +2**<br /><br />Tersyus - "Wrath of Tyr" - is the sibling to the more powerful hammers called Ulhaeron - "Mercy of Tyr" - and Bythialarus - "Wisdom of Tyr." All three hammers were forged together in commemoration of the ascension of the Valjevo dynasty in the kingdom of Phlan in the year 750 DR. Eventually, the three were recovered by the temple of Tyr in Waterdeep and given in turn to those warriors who ventured into the world to combat Tyr's enemies.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Holy Smite: 20% chance against evil creatures to deal 5D4 points of magic damage, and to blind the target for 1 round unless a save vs. spell is made<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HAMM06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM06.png "Dwarven Thrower +2") | **Dwarven Thrower +2**<br /><br />This hammer -- not to be confused with the elven made Dwarf Thrower -- is only usable by dwarves. In the capable hands of a dwarven warrior, the hammer may be thrown at an opponent, and the magic in the hammer draws it back to the hand of its wielder. If it hits an opponent, it does double the damage that a thrown hammer would normally do. Against giants and ogres the hammer does even more damage, due to the special hatred that dwarves hold for these races.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Racial Enemy: inflicts 4 additional points of damage against giants and ogres<br /> Returning: returns to the wielder's hand instantly after an attack is made<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 2D4 + 4<br />Damage type (melee): crushing<br />Damage type (thrown): missile<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Dwarves|
| *HAMM06A*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM06A.png "Dwarven Thrower +2") | **Dwarven Thrower +2**<br /><br />This hammer -- not to be confused with the elven made Dwarf Thrower -- is only usable by dwarves.

| *HAMM06B*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM06B.png "Dwarven Thrower +2") | **Dwarven Thrower +2**<br /><br />This hammer -- not to be confused with the elven made Dwarf Thrower -- is only usable by dwarves.

| *HAMM07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM07.png "Hammer of Thunderbolts +3") | **Hammer of Thunderbolts +3**<br /><br />A dwarven smith, Silverblade, forged this hammer and two other items: a girdle of giant strength and gauntlets of ogre power. His intention was to gift them to his son, who was then a high officer in the dwarven armies, fighting the giant and ogre tribes of the area. Unfortunately Silverblade's son died just after the completion of the three items, and before they could be gifted to him. In his grief Silverblade himself donned the girdle and the gauntlets. Taking up the Hammer of Thunderbolts, he went to battle against the giant folk, and died valiantly.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Shocking: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of electrical damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|

Powerful magical energy flows through this weapon, though its origins are unknown.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 3<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *HAMM09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM09.png "Crom Faeyr +4") | **Crom Faeyr +4**<br /><br />A dwarven smith, Silverblade, forged this hammer and two other items: a girdle of giant strength and gauntlets of ogre power. His intention was to gift them to his son, who was then a high officer in the dwarven armies, fighting the giant and ogre tribes of the area. Unfortunately Silverblade's son died just after the completion of the three items, and before they could be gifted to him. In his grief Silverblade himself donned the girdle and the gauntlets. Taking up the Hammer of Thunderbolts, he went to battle against the giant folk, and died valiantly.<br /><br />Alone, the Hammer of Thunderbolts is a powerful magical weapon, but when merged with a pair of Gauntlets of Ogre Power and a Girdle of Giant Strength it can be used to full effect. Crom Faeyr gifts its users with all the powers of the original recipients, effectively becoming one of the most fearsome weapon in the Realms.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Strength: +5 bonus<br /> Unbalanced: -1/2 attack per round when used as a throwing weapon<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Shocking: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of electrical damage<br /> Returning: returns to the wielder's hand instantly after an attack is made<br /> Thunderclap: when hurled, upon striking the target the hammer emits a great noise, like a clap of thunder, stunning opponents within 5 feet for 1 round (save vs. breath negates)<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 5<br />Damage type (melee): crushing<br />Damage type (thrown): missile<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|

| *HAMM10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/HAMM10.png "Runehammer +3") | **Runehammer +3**<br /><br />Glittering with magical runes this unique specimen of runehammer has been seen a number of times throughout the Realms, always appearing where a powerful evil threat is growing. It seems to patiently wait for someone to take it up, inevitably disappearing once the threat has been eliminated. No one knows for certain where this weapon originate, though the starmetal it's made of is clearly of extraplanar origin. Perhaps it comes from the outer planes to help the righteous of Faerun defend their home, or perhaps its arrival here is simply an accident. Regardless of its origin, it's unusually effective against creatures from other planes of existence.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Magic Resistance: +5%<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Banishing: summoned creatures must save vs. spell or be dismissed<br /> Starmetal: inflicts 4 additional points of damage against extraplanar creatures<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D4 + 4<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: War Hammer<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
