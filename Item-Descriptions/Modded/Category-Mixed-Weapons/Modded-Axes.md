| *AX1H02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AX1H02.png "Battle Axe +1") | **Battle Axe +1**<br /><br />The most common version of the battle axe is a stout pole about four feet in length with a single-edged, trumpet-shaped blade mounted on one end. Battle axes are also called broad axes. This axe is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Axe<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *AX1H03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AX1H03.png "Battle Axe +2") | **Battle Axe +2**<br /><br />The most common version of the battle axe is a stout pole about four feet in length with a single-edged, trumpet-shaped blade mounted on one end. Battle axes are also called broad axes. Magical battle axes are normally crafted by dwarves to help defend their warriors against their harsher neighbors. This magical axe has seen many battles, but its enchantments and craftsmanship make it a very capable weapon still.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Axe<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *AX1H07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AX1H07.png "Bala's Axe") | **Bala's Axe**<br /><br />Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race, he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened by his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench which overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates, especially considering a detect magic spell reveals the axe has no magical properties. After a lengthy career of mage slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Dispelling: removes all magical effects upon the target (save vs. spell neg.)<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Axe<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|

| *AX1H12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AX1H12.png "Stonefire +2") | **Stonefire +2**<br /><br />The Stonefires were an old lineage of dwarves, and the eldest male of the line carried this axe, an heirloom of utmost importance. Unfortunately the Stonefires were decimated in 1150DR, falling in a mere two years to a mysterious plague. Ulgan, keeper of the axe, fled in the hopes of escaping the inevitable, but he died several weeks later. His body was found in the Cloakwood Forest, but the axe was missing.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Flaming: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of fire damage<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Axe<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *AX1H13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AX1H13.png "Frostreaver +1") | **Frostreaver +1**<br /><br />This was the axe of Illgarth, a mighty and deranged warrior that terrorized northern communities long ago. It is not known where he acquired the weapon, but he took a perverse pleasure in unleashing it upon his unfortunate victims. With its icy blade he maimed those not killed, and the berserker would laugh coldly if he recognized his handiwork from a previous visit. Ultimately a group did manage to kill him, and at the request of his victims Frostreaver was buried with him.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Icy: creatures struck suffer 1D4 additional points of cold damage<br /> Chilling: 33% chance target must save vs. spell or be slowed for 3 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Axe<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *AX1H14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/AX1H14.png "Axe of the Unyielding +3") | **Axe of the Unyielding +3**<br /><br />Lonesome Road<br />This was the weapon of a cursed soul, doomed to wander the length and breadth of Faerun for his crimes against the elves of Myth Drannor. Denell Harband was a human involved with the creation of the "Halfaxe Trail." Under the orders of his commander, Halvan the Dark, he forged ahead through elven forests despite protests and repeated attacks. When he was finally captured by the elves, he stated emphatically that he was free of guilt because he was just following his orders. The elven council deemed that Denell be placed under a High Geas to carry his axe from the Sword Coast of Faerun to its borders in the east, and from the Great Glacier to Lurien. It took Denell thirty years to complete his task. When he finished, he was an accomplished warrior, weathered and beaten by years on foreign roads. On his way back to his home, he passed by Harrowdale and saw a wooden statue of Halvan the Dark raised proudly in a small town square. With a single-handed blow, he lodged his huge axe into Halvan's forehead. Never breaking stride, he decided to extend his never ending journey indefinitely, and he was last seen disappearing in the deepest caverns beneath the Marching Mountains.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +10 bonus<br /> Regeneration: wearer regenerates 1 hit point every round<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Axe<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|

Never breaking stride, he decided to extend his never ending journey indefinitely, and he was last seen disappearing in the deepest caverns beneath the Marching Mountains.<br /><br />Enhanced by the magic of the Baalor's Claw, the Axe of the Unyielding is now a most fearsome weapon - a vorpal-edged axe capable of severing an opponents head with a single blow.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Maximum Hit Points: +10 bonus<br /> Regeneration: wearer regenerates 1 hit point every round<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Vorpal: 10% chance target must save vs. death at -2 penalty or die<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Axe<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|

| *KORAX01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/KORAX01.png "Bloodaxe +2") | **Bloodaxe +2**<br /><br />It was the Year of Slaughter, 1090 DR, and countless victims lay slain at the Battle of the Bones. Today the site contains layers of dry white bone, but at the time it was all blood and bile, oozing from each shattered corpse and saturating the fallen equipment. No amount of polishing has been able to restore any weapon retrieved from that dread place, or even begin to remove the taint acquired there.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Bloodlust: each successful hit grants the wielder a +1 cumulative bonus to melee damage for 2 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 2<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Axe<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Berserker|

Its markings are vaguely dwarven, but no dwarf yet encountered on Faerun has claimed a kinship with the mysterious smith, and further investigations are met with gruff explanations and eventually stony silence.
