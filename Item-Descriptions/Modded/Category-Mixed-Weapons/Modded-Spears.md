| *DWSPER01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/DWSPER01.png "Drowcraft Lance +3") | **Drowcraft Lance +3**<br /><br />Many parts of the Underdark of Faerun are suffused with a magical radiation that the drow call faerzress. A remnant of the mighty forces that originally shaped the terrain of the Underdark, faerzress distorts and interferes with certain types of magic.<br />The drow have long sought out places of powerful faerzress in which to raise their cities, since the magical radiation helps to frustrate spying and protect against enemy assaults. The magical energy can also be used in the construction of various powerful magic items.<br />A drowcraft weapon is energized by local earth nodes and the surrounding aura of faerzress. As long as it remains within an earth node or a zone of faerzress, it grants its wielder exceptional accuracy. Drowcraft weapons will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Drowcraft: +2 luck bonus to minimum damage and attack rolls<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER01.png "Spear") | **Spear**<br /><br />Among mankind's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks that had been sharpened at one end. Upon mastering the use of metals, weaponsmiths forged spear heads from iron and steel, and began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain types of polearms.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D6<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER02.png "Spear +1") | **Spear +1**<br /><br />Among mankind's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks that had been sharpened at one end. Upon mastering the use of metals, weaponsmiths forged spear heads from iron and steel, and began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain types of polearms. This particular weapon is magical, having special bonuses to its speed, accuracy, and damage it causes.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER03.png "Backbiter +3") | **Backbiter +3**<br /><br />This cursed spear has the appearance of a magical barbed spear. However, when a combat situation arises, Backbiter will attack the wielder once for every attack made against the wielder's foe. This is a powerful spear, but one must ask if such power is worth using in the end. Backbiter can only be removed through the use of a remove curse spell.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Keen: +10% chance to score critical hits<br /> Vicious: inflicts additional 2D6 points of damage to the target and 1D6 points of damage to the wielder<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER05.png "Spear +2") | **Spear +2**<br /><br />Among mankind's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks that had been sharpened at one end. Upon mastering the use of metals, weaponsmiths forged spear heads from iron and steel, and began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain types of polearms. Another line of tinkering led to the use of magic in spear construction. Tribal shamans would enchant a spear so that it would hit more often, and do greater damage to its wielder's opponents.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER06.png "Spear +3") | **Spear +3**<br /><br />Among mankind's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks that had been sharpened at one end. Upon mastering the use of metals, weaponsmiths forged spear heads from iron and steel, and began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain types of polearms. This spear trembles from the powerful magic used in its creation.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER07.png "Spear of the Unicorn +2") | **Spear of the Unicorn +2**<br /><br />This graceful spear is carved to resemble the elongated horn of a unicorn. Wielders of this spear are immune to charm and hold spells, just as a unicorn might be. Whether the horn is or isn't an actual unicorn horn is the subject of much debate.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Immunity to charm and hold effects<br /> Saving Throws: +3 bonus vs. death<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER08.png "Impaler +3") | **Impaler +3**<br /><br />Pergad the Red-Handed was a famous barbarian warrior near Silverymoon in the 11th century, Dale Reckoning. His tribe's battles against hordes of orcs, goblins, and hill giants are legendary throughout the north. Unfortunately for Pergad, the other tribes of the region decided to move south or settle in the cities of the north rather than fight against the seemingly endless waves of foes. Pergad's tribe, the Tribe of Dead Trees, was the last to make a stand. Though Pergad emerged victorious in a series of difficult battles, his tribe dwindled as quickly as the horde grew. At the Battle of Surbrin Shallows in 1014 DR, Pergad's tribe finally came to its end under cruel ogre clubs and giant-hurled rocks. Legend states that when Pergad finally realized that his tribe was doomed, he drove his trusted spear into the Surbrin riverbed, cursing all the goblins who crossed over the water that his people once thrived on. Orcish shamans claim that the spot where his spear penetrated the rock bled for days. A year later, two tribes of goblins were wiped out by a plague that spread among them after they settled in the Surbrin river valley. The spear subsequently disappeared in the river's currents, and was supposedly dragged into the open sea.<br />The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the nature of the weapon and why it has been the bane of several powerful orc chieftains in the past. As one would guess, when a victim is struck, they are very nearly impaled as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Impaling: creatures struck suffer 1D10 additional points of piercing damage<br /> Returning: returns to the wielder's hand instantly after an attack is made<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type (melee): piercing<br />Damage type (thrown): missile<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER09.png "Talos' Fury +2") | **Talos' Fury +2**<br /><br />Talos, the god of storms, occasionally grants his followers spears such as this as symbols of his power and authority. The electrum plated shaft of this weapon hums with magical power and blue bolts of energy run down the length of the spear, charging it. In battle, when it hits an opponent, it strikes for additional electrical damage. When hurled the lightning bolt like spear magically reappears in the wielder's hand after reaching the target. These weapons are highly sought after by adventurers for their great power.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Returning: returns to the wielder's hand instantly after an attack is made<br /> Shocking: creatures struck suffer 1D6 additional points of electrical damage<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 2<br />Damage type (melee): piercing<br />Damage type (thrown): missile<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER10.png "Spear of Withering +3") | **Spear of Withering +3**<br /><br />The Year of the Awakening, 1001 DR, saw the re-emergence of many ancient evils as treasure-hungry explorers unearthed ruins in several locations. One such breach freed Sek'co Tul, a lich imprisoned beneath the Forest of Mir. He left for some unknown hold, but his opened tomb quickly tainted trees in the area. Druids cleansed the area with fire, but some of the wood was taken by a local mage and made into this spear.<br />Carved from the heart of a rotten Treant, this spear reeks of death. When held in your hands it groans a little, as if reluctant to allow a living thing to touch it. In battle, the Spear of Withering spits a foul poison into its target upon each successful hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Contagious: 15% chance target must save vs. death at -4 penalty or be afflicted by a disease, suffering 1 point of damage per second and being slowed for 1 turn<br /> Envenomed: creatures struck suffer 1D6 points of additional poison damage<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 3<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER11.png "Ixil's Nail +4") | **Ixil's Nail +4**<br /><br />Shortly after the Time of Troubles began the nomadic bandit tribes of the Calimshan desert were united under a single leader; a cruel and brutal giant of a man, the warlord Ixil Xaxsha. From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.<br />Rumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faerun by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.<br />Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear, seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.<br />The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.<br /><br />Though Ixil's body was never found, Ixil's Spike, his fearsome spear and the symbol of his power, was recovered. In an effort to utterly destroy the artifact, it was shattered into several pieces, which were scattered about the Southlands. For many generations this magical shaft has been separated from Ixil's Spike, the enchanted head of the legendary spear. However, even incomplete, this artifact is still a weapon of great power.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Free Action: the wielder is immune to everything, magical and otherwise, that limits his mobility in any way<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 4<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
| *SPER12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Modded/Images/SPER12.png "Ixil's Spike +5") | **Ixil's Spike +5**<br /><br />Shortly after the Time of Troubles began the nomadic bandit tribes of the Calimshan desert were united under a single leader; a cruel and brutal giant of a man, the warlord Ixil Xaxsha.

In an effort to utterly destroy the artifact, it was shattered into several pieces, which were scattered about the Southlands. With shaft and tip reunited, Ixil's Spike can now display its true potential.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Free Action: the wielder is immune to everything, magical and otherwise, that limits his mobility in any way<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Pin: opponent must save vs. death or be pinned for 2 rounds, taking an additional 1D4 + 5 damage each round<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage: 1D6 + 5<br />Damage type: piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type: 2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk<br /> Beast Master|
