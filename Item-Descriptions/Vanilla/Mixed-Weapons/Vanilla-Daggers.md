| *DAGG03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG03.png "Dagger +2") | **Dagger +2**<br /><br />Dagger +2:  'Heart of the Golem'<br />There are no records of this weapon's creator; nevertheless, its existence can be traced back among thieves and murderers to before Dalereckoning.  Its blackened blade was apparently forged from the arcane metals of an iron golem, giving the weapon an appearance as dark as its history.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D4 + 2<br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|

| *DAGG05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG05.png "Throwing Dagger") | **Throwing Dagger**<br /><br />The typical throwing dagger has a pointed, usually double-edged blade, as opposed to a knife, which has a single edge and is a bit shorter than the dagger.  Unlike a dagger, this one has a smaller handle and is balanced differently.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D4<br />Damage type:   missile (piercing)<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG09.png "Silver Dagger - Werebane") | **Silver Dagger - Werebane**<br /><br />Silver Dagger - Werebane:<br />This +1 dagger acts as a +4 dagger vs. lycanthropes. Dynala Goldenhand, an elven ranger who wished to rid her homeland of its were-jackal problem, forged the dagger. She was killed by a tribe of orcs in the Greypeak Mountains as she tracked the jackalwere leader.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D4 + 1 (+4 vs. Lycanthropes)<br />THACO:  +1 bonus (+4 vs. Lycanthropes)<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG10.png "Soultaker Dagger") | **Soultaker Dagger**<br /><br />This dagger weighs heavily in your hand, and is warm to the touch. Merely having it on your person makes you feel uneasy for some reason. The gem mounted in the hilt seems to have an inner light of some sort, though how it can have such illuminations and still be so deathly black at its core, you do not know.<br /><br />Damage:  1D4 <br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 2 <br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG11.png "Boomerang Dagger +2") | **Boomerang Dagger +2**<br /><br />Boomerang Dagger +2<br />Fullen Woolspinner, an ambitious halfling from a well-to-do family, left his home to spend several years adventuring.  During his travels he ended up staying with a family of dwarven weaponsmiths.  Much impressed by their throwing axes, which always returned to the hands of their wielder, Fullen sought to make a dagger that could do the same.  With the help of his dwarven friends he succeeded, creating several of the famous Fullen Boomerang daggers.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: dagger returns to the thrower<br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  2D4 + 2<br />Damage type:  missile (piercing)<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG12.png "Fire Tooth +3") | **Fire Tooth +3**<br /><br />Dagger of Throwing +3:  'Firetooth'<br />This throwing knife is imbued with magical fire, and was supposedly carved from an extracted red dragon tooth.  Tavern tales suggest that the beast is still alive, her anger fueling the enchantment within the weapon.  Though fanciful, the story is consistent, and it is said the dagger returns to the thrower "as though on wings."<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: dagger returns to the thrower<br />THAC0:  +3 bonus, 1D2 fire damage<br />Damage:  2D4 + 3<br />Damage type:  missile (piercing)<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG13.png "Pixie Prick +3
") | **Pixie Prick +3
**<br /><br />Pixie Prick +3<br />The Pixie Prick almost appears to be a toy, so fine and delicate is the workmanship of the blade and handle.  Yet when wielded and the command word 'Sleep' is intoned, the tiny dagger glows with a blue nimbus.  Upon striking an opponent the Pixie Prick releases a surge of powerful magic, potentially inducing a deep slumber.  Legends say that the ancient sprite knight, Alfonso de Noble wielded the Pixie Prick, not as a dagger but as a two-handed sword.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Ability: Target must make a saving throw vs. poison or fall asleep for two rounds<br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D4 + 3<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG14.png "Boneblade +4") | **Boneblade +4**<br /><br />Dagger +4:  'Boneblade'<br />This seemingly simple dagger, steel blade and bone handle, is an incredibly powerful weapon. Forged by an unfortunate duergar smith centuries earlier, the handle was carved from a tooth of a black dragon and the blade was tempered in the blood of its creator. How it has made its way to you is anyone's guess.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D4 + 4<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG15.png "Dagger +2") | **Dagger +2**<br /><br />The typical dagger has a pointed, double-edged blade, as opposed to a knife which has a single edge and is a bit shorter.  This particular dagger is magical, having special bonuses to its speed, accuracy, and damage it causes.  Also, since it is magical, is it capable of striking opponents that are immune to normal weapons, such as vampires, elementals and mummies.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D4 +2<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0 <br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Require: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG16.png "Poisoned Throwing Dagger") | **Poisoned Throwing Dagger**<br /><br />The typical throwing dagger has a pointed, usually double-edged blade, as opposed to a knife, which has a single edge and is a bit shorter than the dagger.  Unlike a dagger, this one has a smaller handle and is balanced perfectly.  A thin coating of poison has been applied to each poisoned throwing dagger, making it a lethal tool in the hands of trained assassins.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D4<br />Poison Damage: 2 hit points of damage per second<br />Poison Duration: 10 seconds<br />Damage type:   missile (piercing)<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG17.png "Stiletto of Demarchess +2") | **Stiletto of Demarchess +2**<br /><br />Stiletto of Demarchess +2<br />Most who take up the trade of murder for hire do so for reasons other than personal pleasure, but not so the Lady Demarche.  She took special pleasure in the torture of her targets...which is why she made this dagger.  With but one touch of its polished blade an opponent was rendered immobile, incapable of so much as screaming, yet the victim could watch and feel all that happened to them.  While her opponent was thus held, the Lady would slowly bleed them, sometimes taking several hours before allowing her subject to succumb to the final agony of death.  The Lady finally fell victim to her own evil; disarmed by a rival and struck by her own Stiletto her fate was soon sealed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: <br /> Hold Person: a 20% chance each hit that the victim must save vs. death or be held for two rounds<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D4 +2<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0 <br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|

| *DAGG21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG21.png "Dagger of the Star +4") | **Dagger of the Star +4**<br /><br />Rumored to have been dropped from the Heavens by a careless lesser deity, this dagger is a favorite among thieves and assassins as it will sometimes magically hide its user from the victim's sight.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br />   <br />Combat Abilities:  5% chance of making the user go invisible for 60 seconds after each successful attack.<br /><br />THAC0:  +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D4 + 4<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
| *DAGG22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DAGG22.png "Dagger of the Star +5") | **Dagger of the Star +5**<br /><br />With the Star Sapphires encrusting its hilt, this small blade is one of the most dangerous weapons in the Realms.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br />   <br />Combat Abilities:<br />  15% chance of making the user go invisible for 60 seconds after each successful attack.<br />  Star Bolt - each successful hit has a 5% chance of causing an extra 1D8 fire and 1D8 electrical damage.<br /><br />THAC0:  +5 bonus<br />Damage:  1D4 + 5<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 1<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Dagger<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric|
