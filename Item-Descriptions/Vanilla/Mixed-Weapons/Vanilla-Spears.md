This drow lance is a superior version of the traditional spear, often used by drow foot soldiers.<br />This item, like most drow equipment, is created using Adamantine, an alloy of adamantite that quickly turns to dust if removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +3<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SPER01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER01.png "Spear") | **Spear**<br /><br />One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  Having reached this end, weaponers began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D6<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SPER02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER02.png "Spear +1") | **Spear +1**<br /><br />One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  Having reached this end, weaponers began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.  This spear is slightly different though, as it has been imbued with certain magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +1<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SPER03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER03.png "Spear +3, Backbiter") | **Spear +3, Backbiter**<br /><br />This cursed spear will appear as a magical spear, however when a combat situation arises, the wielder will attack an enemy and Backbiter will attack the wielder.  For every attack made, Backbiter will attack the foe and also the wielder.  This is a powerful spear, but one must ask if it is worth it in the end.  The only way that Backbiter can be removed is by a remove curse spell.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />*CURSED*<br />THAC0:  +3<br />Damage:  1D6 +3<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Special:  3 (piercing) damage inflicted upon the wielder upon every successful hit<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SPER05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER05.png "Spear +2") | **Spear +2**<br /><br />One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  Having reached this end, weaponers began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.  Another line of tinkering led to the integration of magic with spears.  Tribal shaman would enchant the spears so that they would hit more often and do greater damage to their wielder's opponents.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +2<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SPER06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER06.png "Spear +3") | **Spear +3**<br /><br />One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  This spear trembles from the powerful magic used in its creation.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +3<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SPER07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER07.png "Spear of the Unicorn +2") | **Spear of the Unicorn +2**<br /><br />Spear of the Unicorn +2<br />This graceful spear is carved to resemble the elongated horn of the unicorn.  Wielders of this spear are immune to charm and hold spells, just as a unicorn might be.  Whether the horn is or isn't an actual unicorn horn is the subject of much debate.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities: <br /> Immunity to charm and hold person<br /> +3 to all saves vs. death<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +2<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By: <br /> Cleric <br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SPER08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER08.png "Spear +3, Impaler") | **Spear +3, Impaler**<br /><br />Spear +3, Impaler<br />The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the vicious nature of the weapon and why it has been a favorite of several powerful orc chieftains in the past.  When a victim is struck they are, as one would guess, very nearly impaled: run through as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +3, +10 piercing damage<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By: <br /> Cleric <br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SPER09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER09.png "Spear +1, Halcyon") | **Spear +1, Halcyon**<br /><br />Halcyon Spear +1<br />The electrum-plated shaft of this weapon hums with magical power.  Occasionally blue bolts of energy run down the length of the spear, charging it.  In battle when it hits an opponent it strikes for additional electricity damage.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +1, +1 electricity damage<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Spear<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By: <br /> Cleric <br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SPER10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER10.png "Spear of Withering +4") | **Spear of Withering +4**<br /><br />Spear of Withering +4<br />Carved from the heart of a rotten Treant, this spear smells of death.  When held in your hands it groans a little, as if reluctant to allow a living thing to touch it.  In battle the Spear of Withering spits a foul poison into its target upon each successful hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: + 4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 4, + 4 poison damage<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SPER11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER11.png "Ixil's Nail +4") | **Ixil's Nail +4**<br /><br />For many generations this magical shaft has been separated from Ixil's Spike, the enchanted head of the legendary spear.  However, even incomplete, this artifact is still a weapon of great power.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 4<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SPER12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SPER12.png "Ixil's Spike +6") | **Ixil's Spike +6**<br /><br />With shaft and tip reunited, Ixil's Spike is a fearsome weapon.  During the battle the head can detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reforms on the end of the spear.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities: Permanent Free Action<br /><br />Combat Abilities:  With each successful hit, the opponent must save or be pinned for 3 rounds, taking an additional 1D6+5 damage each round.<br /><br />THAC0: + 6 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 6<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 1 <br />Proficiency Type: Spear <br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
