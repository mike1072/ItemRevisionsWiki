| *REAVER*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/REAVER.png "Unholy Reaver") | **Unholy Reaver**<br /><br />Unholy Reaver<br /><br />This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance and is only usable by anti-paladins.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +5<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 15<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Two Handed sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Anti-paladin|
| *NPSW03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/NPSW03.png "Hallowed Redeemer") | **Hallowed Redeemer**<br /><br />Hallowed Redeemer<br /><br />Keldorn distinguished himself early in his career as a paladin, and received this blade as a boon from Torm.  It is exceptionally accurate, but also protects him in battle with a special Fireshield, and any that strike him while he wields it suffer Torm's wrath in the form of magical damage. None but Keldorn may use this sword.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities: 5 points of magic damage to any who deal out any damage to the wielder.<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 + 2<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Keldorn|
| *SW2H01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H01.png "Two-Handed Sword") | **Two-Handed Sword**<br /><br />The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword.  Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons.  In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened.  Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword.  The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D10<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 15<br />Speed Factor: 10<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SW2H02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H02.png "Two-Handed Sword +1") | **Two-Handed Sword +1**<br /><br />The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword.  Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons.  In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened.  Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword.  The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.  This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +1<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 9<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SW2H03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H03.png "Cursed Berserking Sword +3") | **Cursed Berserking Sword +3**<br /><br />Two-Handed Sword, Cursed Berserking +3<br />This is a cursed sword which performs perfectly under every test, save the heat of battle.  Upon entering combat, the wielder will immediately go berserk, killing everything within reach until either calming down or falling unconscious.  A very powerful sword, but one must decide whether or not it is worth the risk.  Even after the battle-fury has ended, this sword can only be removed via an exorcism using a remove curse spell.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +3<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Special:<br />    Causes the wielder to go berserk<br />    Can only be removed with a 'remove curse' spell<br />Weight: 15<br />Speed Factor: 10<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SW2H06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H06.png "Spider's Bane") | **Spider's Bane**<br /><br />Spider's Bane was originally forged by the dwarves of the Orothiar tribe in Cloakwood.  They created the blade to help foster good will between them and the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate.  Wielded by the Grand Dukes for about a century, the sword was eventually lost, ironically in a fight against ettercaps and spiders.  Who wields the blade is now unknown, but its recovery would aid greatly in fighting the current spider infestation that plagues the Cloakwood.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D10  +2<br />THACO:  +2 bonus<br />Special:  Free Action (while equipped) -  protects the wielder from any magics that affect movement such as hold and web.<br />Damage Type:  slashing<br />Weight:  10<br />Speed Factor:  8<br />Proficiency Type:  Two Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br />Druid<br />Cleric<br />Mage<br />Thief|
| *SW2H07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H07.png "Harbinger +3") | **Harbinger +3**<br /><br />Two-Handed Sword +3: Harbinger<br />When the hero Trueblood destroyed the Harbinger, a demon gorging itself on the blood of peasant folk near Luskan, he bound its essence in the only vessel capable of holding it, his fabled sword, Deliverance.  Though the evil creature was dominated by the will of the semi-sentient blade, it was not truly defeated, and it transformed the weapon from within.  Now it acts much like any other enchanted weapon, but when it strikes, there is a small chance that a fireball erupts, a sign that the demon within still rages at its imprisonment.  There is also a chance that any ogre it hits will be turned to stone.  Whether this is an ability of the demon or a vestigial power of the original blade is not known.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: Fireball<br /> There is a 5% chance per hit that a 10d6 fireball explodes, centered on the target<br />Flesh to Stone<br /> All ogres when hit must save vs. spells or be turned to stone<br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +3<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  10<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW2H08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H08.png "Soul Reaver +4") | **Soul Reaver +4**<br /><br />Two-Handed Sword +4: Soul Reaver<br />A social faux pas placed upstart Andor Licon in a duel with Baron Eeirk, heir to a warrior king.  Though they seemed of even skill, Andor grew oddly weaker with each hit of the Baron's family blade.  Panicking, he bade his bodyguards kill Eeirk.  Despite his claims of morality, some noted that the young noble had positioned his men before the duel was even underway, and though he professed disdain for its dark magic, Andor made a tidy fortune off the sale of the evil blade. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: Each hit makes the target receive a cumulative 2 point penalty to their THAC0<br /> Duration: 20 rounds<br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +4<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  10<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Good characters|
| *SW2H09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H09.png "Warblade +4") | **Warblade +4**<br /><br />Two-Handed Sword +4, Warblade<br />This large sword is an enchanted version of the barbaric swords of the Northern tribes. Forged during battle and dipped in the blood of the brave fallen, the enchantment granted to the blade by the barbarian gods is incredible. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D12 +4<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  11<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW2H10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H10.png "Carsomyr +5") | **Carsomyr +5**<br /><br />The Holy Avenger: Carsomyr<br />Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, such that the sword itself never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today.  It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it.  The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease.  Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities: <br />    50% Magic Resistance<br />    Dispel magic 3 times per day<br />Combat Abilities: <br />    +5 damage to chaotic evil opponents in addition to other bonuses.<br />    Dispels magic whenever the sword strikes an opponent<br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage:  1D12 +5<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  7<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Paladins|
| *SW2H11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H11.png "Two-Handed Sword +2") | **Two-Handed Sword +2**<br /><br />A derivative of the long sword, the two-handed sword is significantly longer, both in blade and hilt.  Its primary function is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.  This magical version is even more capable of such functions, serving as a fearful reminder of what comes of the union between weapons and sorcery.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D10 +2<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SW2H12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H12.png "Flame Of The North") | **Flame Of The North**<br /><br />Two-Handed Sword: Flame of the North<br />The title does not refer to the blade itself, but rather to the woman who originally wielded it in the icy hinterlands of Faerun.  Her name was Carerra, and she was a veritable firestorm that swept across arctic trolls and the northern orcish tribes.  She was a hated enemy of many a shaman whose magic often floundered against her fury. After a lifetime of raucous battle, it was old age that eventually claimed her.  The sword was passed to her granddaughter, an adventurer, who presumably brought it to Amn.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities: 10% magic resistance<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +2, +4 extra damage to chaotic evil opponents<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SW2H13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H13.png "Spider's Bane") | **Spider's Bane**<br /><br />Spider's Bane was originally forged by the dwarves of the Orothiar tribe in Cloakwood.  They created the blade to help foster good will between them and the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate.  Wielded by the Grand Dukes for about a century, the sword was eventually lost, ironically in a fight against ettercaps and spiders.  Who wields the blade is now unknown, but its recovery would aid greatly in fighting the current spider infestation that plagues the Cloakwood.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D10  +2<br />THACO:  +2 bonus<br />Special:  Free Action (while equipped) -  protects the wielder from any magics that affect movement such as hold and web.<br />Damage Type:  slashing<br />Weight:  10<br />Speed Factor:  8<br />Proficiency Type:  Two Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br />Druid<br />Cleric<br />Mage<br />Thief|
| *SW2H14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H14.png "Lilarcor") | **Lilarcor**<br /><br />Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot.  As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant.  He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match.  Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak.  His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree.  That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth.  He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero.  Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance".<br />It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence.  If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity.  He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.<br />As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away.  Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt", "Oh yeah!  Got 'im good", and "Beware my bite for it might...might...might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D10 +3<br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Equipped Abilities:<br />    Immunity to Charm<br />    Immunity to Confusion<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SW2H15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H15.png "Silver Sword") | **Silver Sword**<br /><br />Silver Sword<br />This Vorpal Silver Sword radiates a dark aura when you examine it, and the blade is so finely sharpened it could likely sever a head in a single blow.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> 25% chance each hit that target must make a saving throw vs death (-2 penalty) or die.<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +3<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 15<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SW2H16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H16.png "Sword of Chaos +2") | **Sword of Chaos +2**<br /><br />Sarevok's Sword of Chaos<br />The blade of Sarevok, brother of <CHARNAME>, used in the battle they fought in faraway Baldur's Gate.  <CHARNAME> prevailed, destroying Sarevok's plans and rescuing the Sword Coast from the brink of war.  The sword itself defies identification, likely forged specifically for Sarevok to best focus the infernal energy he hoped to control.  Much of its power died with him.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Abilities: each hit drains one hit point from the target and transfers it to the wielder.  This will not heal beyond the wielder's maximum.<br /><br />Damage:  1D10 +2<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief<br /> Monk|
| *SW2H17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H17.png "Gram the Sword of Grief +5") | **Gram the Sword of Grief +5**<br /><br />This is one of the many weapons of the great hero Siegfried.  The blade is particularly sharp and well balanced, and in a certain light one can see the faint image of a serpent within the hilt.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:  10% Chance of 2d12 poison damage<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +5<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  9<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW2H18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H18.png "Gram the Sword of Grief +5") | **Gram the Sword of Grief +5**<br /><br />Siegfried's fearsome blade is even more powerful with the Heart of the Damned set into its pommel.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities:<br />  5% Magic Resistance when equipped<br /><br />Combat Abilities: <br />  10% Chance of 2d12 poison damage<br />  Each hit target must save vs. death (with a -5 penalty) or lose 1 level<br /><br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +5<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  9<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW2H19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H19.png "Carsomyr +6") | **Carsomyr +6**<br /><br />Even a Holy Relic as powerful as Carsomyr is made even greater when combined with the Eye of Tyr.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities: <br />    50% Magic Resistance<br />    Dispel magic 3 times per day<br />Combat Abilities: <br />    +6 damage to chaotic evil opponents in addition to other bonuses.<br />    Dispels magic whenever the sword strikes an opponent<br />THAC0: +6 bonus<br />Damage:  1D12 +6<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  6<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Paladins|
| *SW2H20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H20.png "Two-Handed Sword +3") | **Two-Handed Sword +3**<br /><br />A derivative of the long sword, the two-handed sword is significantly longer, both in blade and hilt.  Its primary function is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.  This magical version is even more capable of such functions, serving as a fearful reminder of what comes of the union between weapons and sorcery.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D10 +3<br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 9<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
| *SW2H21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW2H21.png "Psion's Blade +5") | **Psion's Blade +5**<br /><br />Some believe this massive blade to be of Drow origin, though others dispute this claim.  However, all agree this great sword was fashioned with a single purpose... to rid the world of the Illithid. Those who wield the Psion's Blade are immune to the Mind Flayer's psionic attacks.  The bewildering gaze of Umber Hulks, often found serving the Illithid, are similarly rendered harmless.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Grants immunity to confusion and all Psionic attacks when wielded.<br /><br />Damage:  1D10 +5<br />THAC0: +5 bonus<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 9<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Two-Handed Sword<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 14 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
