| *CLCK07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/CLCK07.png "Nymph Cloak") | **Nymph Cloak**<br /><br />The fabled Nymph Cloak is renowned for its ability to increase the Charisma of even the most surly dwarf.

| *CLCK24*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/CLCK24.png "Cloak of Reflection") | **Cloak of Reflection**<br /><br />Cloak of Reflection<br />Vorn Druidslayer crafted this cloak and used it with great success in his campaign to eliminate the druids from all the woods south of Baldur's Gate.

| *CLCK27*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/CLCK27.png "Cloak of the Sewers") | **Cloak of the Sewers**<br /><br />Cloak of the Sewers<br />For a sewer dweller like Ivan, survival meant going where others refused.  Hiding from thugs, Ivan went so deep into the sewers beneath Baldur's Gate, that he found caverns of natural caves, some of which opened to the ocean.  Within one cave, Ivan discovered what he thought was a ruined cloak, all torn and stained.  He tossed it into the fire he started, but it would not burn.  Curious, he donned it and with some prying he discovered its hidden abilities.

The most common forms are a circular piece of fabric with a hole in the center for the head, and fabric draped from neck, connected by a chain, brooch, cord, or pins.  Talented drow weavers have woven strands of adamantine into the cloak, thus rendering it useless if exposed to the light -- the effect of which will turn the cloak to dust.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Hide in Shadows: + 75%<br />Move Silent: + 75%<br />Saving Throw vs. Breath: +6|

He made no shelter, wanting to feel the land unhindered.  Nature may have appreciated the intent, she also knows that, for all their dedication, at times her children can be foolish.  Cernd found this cloak before the cold season set in, seemingly woven to fit him from the very undergrowth.  The message was clear: he can appreciate the rain while still seeking shelter from it.  Only Cernd may use this cloak.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class:  +1 bonus<br />Saving Throw:  +1 bonus<br />Weight:  3|
