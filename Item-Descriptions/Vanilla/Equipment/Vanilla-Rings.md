| *NPRING01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/NPRING01.png "de'Arnise Signet Ring") | **de'Arnise Signet Ring**<br /><br />de'Arnise Signet Ring<br /><br />This ring was given to Nalia by her father upon her ascension to adulthood.  Bonded to her blood as it is, the ring may not be removed from Nalia, nor its powers used by anyone else.  The ring grants a +2 bonus to all saving throws, +2 armor class bonus, and 50% resistance to fire.|
| *RING02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING02.png "Ring of Fire Resistance") | **Ring of Fire Resistance**<br /><br />Ring of Fire Resistance:  'Batalista's Passport'<br />The grand mage Batalista intended this item to aid in his travels in the plane of fire, and it is said he repeatedly summoned a Salamander from that realm to aid in the construction of this ring.  Not being known for their patience, it is likely he should not have pestered his "instructor" quite so much.  The finger bearing the finished ring was indeed untouched by the inferno that claimed his tower.  Had that finger still been attached, Batalista himself might have fared better.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Fire Resistance:  +40%<br />Not usable by:|
| *RING03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING03.png "Ring of Animal Friendship") | **Ring of Animal Friendship**<br /><br />Ring of Animal Friendship:  'Druid's Ring'<br />A druid order in Cormanthor is said to cautiously guard the secret to the construction of these rings, which have never been seen in the possession of anyone outside their immediate membership.  How this particular ring escaped the protection of their forest is unknown, but there are rumors that an outcast could have brought it into exile with him.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special:  Charm animal unless save vs. wands<br />Range:  40 ft<br />Area:  1 animal<br />Duration:  10 turns<br /><br /><br />|
| *RING04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING04.png "Ring of Clumsiness") | **Ring of Clumsiness**<br /><br />Ring of Clumsiness:  'The Jester's Folly'<br />The most notorious owner of this ring made a substantial living exploiting its cursed nature.  Gregoria the Foole, a jester by trade, would use his incomparable sleight of hand to switch this ring with that of a patsy taken from his audience.  The rest of his performance would involve the mocking of the newly clumsy individual, much to the delight of their comrades.  The ring was removed (by a method known only to the wily jester) only once the stooge had promised no reprisals for the treatment he had received; though Gregoria frequently still had to make a hasty retreat.  His last known performance was rumored to have been an ill-humored mage in Zhentil Keep; a show from which he did not flee quite fast enough.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Dexterity:  reduced by 50%<br />Stealth:  reduced by 50%<br />Spells:  75% casting failure<br />Special:  can only be removed by a 'remove curse' spell|
| *RING05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING05.png "Ring of Invisibility") | **Ring of Invisibility**<br /><br />Ring of Invisibility:  'Sandthief's Ring'<br />Held by a master thief for the better part of a generation, this ring was put to bold use in the markets of Waterdeep.  Working a crowd in broad daylight, the rogue would steal countless numbers of purses from nobles, replacing them with bags of sand so the theft would go unnoticed.  His identity was never known, but the name "Sandthief" was cursed loudly in its stead.  It is rumored he retired, and now lives among the nobles he used to rob.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special:  Wearer becomes invisible until an attack is made.  This ability may be used once per day.|

History records that the rings remained within that family for at least 13 generations, though they were all apparently lost within the space of one.  Enmity between the King and the family of the creator may be to blame.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class:  +1 bonus<br />Saving Throws:  +1 bonus|
| *RING07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING07.png "Ring of Protection +2") | **Ring of Protection +2**<br /><br />Ring of Protection +2:  'The Guard's Ring'<br />The Guard was an immortal sentry assigned to protect a tomb that sheltered the body of a princess of the Akanal.  Over millennia respect for the grave disappeared with the memory of the royal family, and adventurers began to try their luck with the Guard.  It was inevitable that he would eventually be bested, and when he was, the ring he wore was one of many treasures taken from the tomb.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class:  +2 bonus<br />Saving Throws:  +2 bonus|
| *RING08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING08.png "Ring of Wizardry") | **Ring of Wizardry**<br /><br />Ring of Wizardry:  'Reaching Ring'<br />This ring is masterfully enchanted, allowing the wearer to memorize more spells than normally possible.

| *RING09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING09.png "Ring of Free Action") | **Ring of Free Action**<br /><br />Ring of Free Action:  'Edventar's Gift'<br />This ring was given to the reef scavenger and hunter known only as Edventar, by a group of aquatic elves long his friends.  His help in routing the "Pirate Queen" Yenandra of Dambrath was instrumental in their survival, though Yenandra continues to be feared anywhere the water meets land.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special:  The wearer is immune to everything,  magical and otherwise,  that affects mobility in any way.  This includes haste and slow spells.|
| *RING20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING20.png "Ring of Energy") | **Ring of Energy**<br /><br />Ring of Energy:  'The Victor'<br />Crafted by Drow mages of the Underdark, this weapon was used in an arranged battle between two rival houses.  Each combatant was allowed to use a single magic item to aid his efforts.  This ring was the weapon used by the victor of the contest, though he never laid hands on it.  It was worn by his sibling and fired from the crowd, striking his opponent squarely in the back.  Everyone witnessing agreed it was a brilliant interpretation of the rules.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  2D6 (no save)<br />Range:  120 ft<br />Area: 1 creature|

| *RING23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING23.png "Ring of Folly") | **Ring of Folly**<br /><br />Ring of Folly:  'Discipliner'<br />Oft the bane of the careless mage, this ring was actually used to promote humility.  Hergat Norin, a grand wizard of Narfell, would give the Discipliner to his most skilled, and most egotistical, students.  Through their blind arrogance they would mistake the ring as a reward for their "obvious brilliance," and not the punishment of a disapproving teacher.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Intelligence:  set to 3<br />Wisdom:  set to 3<br />Special:  infects the wearer with a feeblemind that can only be removed with a 'remove curse' spell|

| *RING39*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RING39.png "Ring of Gaxx") | **Ring of Gaxx**<br /><br />Ring of Gaxx<br />This ring is relatively unadorned, but the vile magic within radiates intense evil.  Indeed, its creator, Kangaxx, was no less evil himself, even before millennia of undeath honed his power.  It is said that a cadre of Netheril mages fought and imprisoned the demilich once, but being unable to truly destroy him they became liches themselves to stand guard over his remains.

It was likely found on some distant plane, and as such, its maker will remain a mystery to you.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Spells:  Gives two extra second level spells, one extra third level spell and one extra fourth level spell<br /><br />Only usable by:<br />Mage|
