| *BRAC01*<br />![Icon](../Images/BRAC01.png "Bracers of Defense AC 8") | **Bracers of Defense AC 8**<br /><br />Bracers are thick bands of metal or leather that are strapped, belted, or tied to a character's forearm.  Generally, the magic that is instilled in bracers is good only during combat, since most bracers help protect the wearer from injury, or improve chances to strike at an opponent.  Exceptions do exist, though such specialized items are rare at best. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 8<br />Weight: 2|

The death of this champion marked the disappearance of this magical item, but rumors persist that they are used to this day in competitive combat across the lands.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 6<br />Weight: 2|
| *BRAC04*<br />![Icon](../Images/BRAC04.png "Bracers of Archery") | **Bracers of Archery**<br /><br />Bracers of Archery:  'The Dale's Protector'<br />During a dangerous meeting with a rival ruler, the King of the Great Dale requested the protection of his best archers in addition to his usual guard. The archers, each equipped with an enchanted bow and bracers, hid within range of the gathering. As predicted, enemy troops attempted to seize the King and force their will over his rule, but none had anticipated the amazing accuracy and lethality of the hidden archers. The King was able to escape unharmed; in fact, none of the ambush members even lived to approach him. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 (missile weapons only)<br />Weight:  2<br />Not usable by:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Cleric|
| *BRAC11*<br />![Icon](../Images/BRAC11.png "Bracers of Binding") | **Bracers of Binding**<br /><br />These bracers appear to be Bracers of Specialization but when donned, bind the wearers wrists together, making it quite difficult to wield a weapon or cast a spell. These bracers are sometimes offered as rewards for services rendered by the drow. The recipient, believing them to be very powerful, will often don them before examining them. At this point, the drow find it amusing to conjure a hook horror.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special:  Casting failure 75%<br />THAC0:  +5 penalty<br />Damage:  -5 penalty|
| *BRAC13*<br />![Icon](../Images/BRAC13.png "Bracers of Defense AC 5") | **Bracers of Defense AC 5**<br /><br />Bracers of Defense AC 5<br />Baron Tiri of the North commanded ten of these bracers to be made, one for each of his bodyguards.  The Baron thought it amusing when bandits - thinking them easy targets for they wore no armor -- would attack him and his men as they made excursions across the land.  The Guards of Tiri swiftly dealt with the would be attackers.  Of course Baron Tiri himself never wore a set of bracers and it was this unfortunate oversight that led to his death at the hands of an assassin's poison dagger.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 2|

**<br /><br />Bracers of Defense AC 4<br />Sometimes known as Gauntlets of Chain Mail, these bracers were first worn by Tapid Gornoak.  He was still an active warrior at the age of seventy-five but the weight of his armor was getting harder and harder to bear.  A companion, the sorceress Nadalarin, created these bracers for him.  She also cast a permanent illusion over him so that his men would think he still wore his heavy chain.  Tapid died twenty years later, his hands wrapped around the neck of an orc chief when old age took him.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 2|

**<br /><br />Bracers of Defense AC 3<br />Grinning Glen, the Knight of Fools, wore these bracers while competing in jousting tourneys.  With his skill, charm, and bravado -- no man other than he would joust without armor --  he soon became a favorite to the ladies that watched the events.   Too much of a favorite it would seem, for one afternoon he was caught frolicking with a knight's betrothed.    A challenge was issued, but in his rush Glen forget to don his bracers.  Glen died with a confused grin on his face as the knight's sword struck him, never knowing his own folly.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 2|

Seems he'd stolen an artifact from a powerful mage and tried escaping, with little success.  His possessions went to a nephew, who took up the same trade as his uncle, and became especially good at pickpocketing.  Whether these gloves were magical before falling into Fong's hands or if they are somehow imbued with the master's essence is not known.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Pickpocketing:  +20% Bonus|

He paid a local archer to fire arrows at him.  As the arrows approached, Foik's hands would move of their own accord, either knocking the arrow away or catching it.  He earned more than a few pieces of gold for his troubles, and these earnings attracted some shadowy figures to Foik's tent that evening.
