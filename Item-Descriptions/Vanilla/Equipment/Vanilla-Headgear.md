# Vanilla Helmets
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *HELM01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HELM01.png "Helmet") | **Helmet**<br /><br />This class of open-face helmet, made of reinforced leather or metal, covers most of the head, save the face and neck.  These helmets commonly provide protection for the nose.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus:  None<br />Special:  Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 2<br />Not Usable By:<br />Mage<br />Bard<br />Thief|
| *HELM02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HELM02.png "Helm of Opposite Alignment") | **Helm of Opposite Alignment**<br /><br />The cursed Helm of Alignment Change is a truly fearsome item. As its name suggests, it has the power to alter the fundamental ethical framework, nay, the very identity of anyone unlucky enough to wear it. It can ruin homes, friendships, even entire cities or nations. Should the legions of evil ever force one onto the head of a benevolent Solar, the multiverse, as we know it, will surely meet an abrupt and painful end.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus:  none<br />Special: <br />    Alignment will become opposite<br />    Protects against critical hits<br />    Can only be removed by a 'remove curse' spell<br />Weight:  2<br />|
| *HELM03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HELM03.png "Helm of Glory") | **Helm of Glory**<br /><br />Helm of glory:  'Helm of the Noble'<br />Named for its original owner, Sir Tain the Noble, this helm saw many great battles in his possession.  It was eventually passed on to Sir Tain's squire, who had served him faithfully for almost ten years.  Alas, the young man had neither the strength, nor the skill to uphold his master's legacy.  It is rumored he lost his life in the pursuit of a worthy, but ultimately futile cause, and the helm has had many owners since. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: +1 bonus<br />Charisma:  +1 bonus<br />Special:  Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 2<br />Not Usable By:<br />Mage<br />Bard<br />Thief |
| *HELM04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HELM04.png "Helmet of Defense") | **Helmet of Defense**<br /><br />Helm of defense:  'Gift of Peace'<br />Prized for its noble origin as much as for its benefits to the wearer, this helm was originally intended to be a simple gift.  There was no great crisis at hand, nor dangerous evil to be overthrown; just a wish for a friend to give a gift to another.  It could just have easily been a good book or bottle of wine, but adventurers are eminently more practical in their gift giving.  The helm has seen many great battles since its creation, but the simple virtue at its core is what has always been remembered.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus:  none<br />Saving Throws:  +1 bonus<br />Electrical resistance:  +20%<br />Cold resistance:  +20%<br />Fire resistance:  +20%<br />Special:  Protects Against Critical Hits<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br />Mage<br />Bard<br />Thief|

She would later attribute her gathered wealth solely to its power, though likely it was as much her keen eyes as anything.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus:  None<br />Special:<br />  Protects Against Critical Hits<br />  Grants wearer infravision up to 120 ft<br />Weight: 3<br />Not Usable By:<br />Mage<br />Bard<br />Thief|
