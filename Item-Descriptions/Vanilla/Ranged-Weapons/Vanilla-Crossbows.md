Scant few of these weapons survive to this day, mainly due to the eventual annihilation of the king's forces by a coalition of subjugated lands.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +5 bonus<br />Damage:  +2 (missile)<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Crossbow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

Some bowmen have used it regardless, and many to great effect, but the drawbacks must be carefully considered.

It is enchanted as well, likely to keep the mechanism working smoothly.  It bears the hallmarks of the inventor's god, Gond.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage:  +3 (missile), +2 fire damage<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 9<br />Proficiency Type: Crossbow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
