| *BOW05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW05.png "Short Bow") | **Short Bow**<br /><br />Short bows were the first to be developed, although they were not called such.  This is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a long bow.  Short bow staves are about 5 feet long on the average.  As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges.  Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length.  The former resulted in what is now called the long bow.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|

This is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a long bow. This is a magical short-bow, giving the user an additional +1 to hit.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *BOW08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW08.png "Eagle Bow") | **Eagle Bow**<br /><br />Short bow, eagle bow:  'Protector of the Dryads'<br />In order to protect their community from an encroaching orc logging encampment, the hero Hannable the White was given this magnificent bow by the dryads of Gulthmere Forest.  A deadly confrontation followed when the loggers dared to try and cut down a great oak tree, nearly killing the dryad linked to it.  With the help of powerful forest animals Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood.  The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest.  Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily... nay, VERY happily ever after!<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2<br />Damage: +2<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *BOW14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW14.png "Tuigan Bow +1") | **Tuigan Bow +1**<br /><br />Tuigan Short Bow +1<br />The Tuigans are a nomadic people widely dispersed across the steppe regions of Faerun but bound together by a common bloodline.  The bows they make are especially tailored for their mobile warriors, and the process used is carefully guarded, but the result is well known: any bow of Tuigan origin can be fired faster than is possible with a normal one.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: 3 shots per round<br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage:  +1<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|

The lich Tansheron gave this bow to his Watcher, the guardian of his keep who stood atop a tower with neither entrance nor exit.  When anyone approached, down would fall a never-ending rain of phantom arrows until they were dead or fled.  How this bow was wrested from the Watcher's hand is not known, but would probably make a great tavern story.<br /><br />Note: avoid equipping normal arrows on your character, else the bow will fire these instead of the phantom arrows.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Ability: This powerful bow requires no ammunition<br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Short Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|

This is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a long bow.  Short bow staves are about 5 feet long on the average.  This short bow is the rival of any of the larger bows.

It is said that Gesen prepared to retire from his craft after selling the invaluable weapon, only to have the bow wrested from his grasp by a thief who used it to end Gesen's own life.

| *BOW03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW03.png "Long Bow") | **Long Bow**<br /><br />The long bow is similar to the short bow, except that the staff is about as long as the archer is tall, usually 6 to 6.5 feet.  It has two advantages over the short bow: better range and hence, it is much more accurate.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

| *BOW07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW07.png "Long Bow of Marksmanship") | **Long Bow of Marksmanship**<br /><br />Long bow of marksmanship:  'The Dead Shot'<br />Driven by years of rivalry, the Dukes of Spandeliyon and Delthuntle decided to organize a private contest that would proclaim the better archer between them.  Both boasted the power of their magical bows, but that wasn't enough for Edwall Dest, Duke of Spandeliyon.  He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest he couldn't help gloat in his advantage.  The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed.  Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself.  The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THACO: +3<br />Damage: +2<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BOW12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW12.png "Elven Court Bow +3") | **Elven Court Bow +3**<br /><br />Longbow +3: Elven Court<br />This yew bow is more a work of art than a weapon of war; fine engravings dance over the polished wood, and the bowstring gleams of gold, almost singing when drawn.  This was a ceremonial bow in the Elven Court for a thousand years, though that is scarcely a single lifetime in elven terms.  Every 50 years or so it was granted to someone who had performed a great service, the recipient eventually choosing who would hold it next.  Two centuries ago a human, Yin Pon, rescued an elven prince and was gifted the bow, which he carried with him to Baldur's Gate, where it was subsequently lost.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +4<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

Even though the longbow is slightly slower than the short bow, it has more range and is more accurate.  The smooth staff of this bow is warm to the touch, just a hint of the energy that surges through the wood.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

| Item | Description |

| *BOW01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW01.png "Composite Long Bow") | **Composite Long Bow**<br /><br />Composite bows are long bows or short bows whose staves are made from more than one type of material.  This gives greater flexibility and makes arrows fired from this bow deliver more damage.  To wield such a powerful bow requires a strength of 18.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage:  +1<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Longbow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 18 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief<br /> Bard|

This gives greater flexibility, and thus better range.  These were developed after the normal long bow.  This magical bow requires a strength of 18 to wield.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  +1 bonus<br />Weight: 9<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 18 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief<br /> Bard|
| *BOW09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW09.png "Ripper +2") | **Ripper +2**<br /><br />Ripper +2<br />This composite longbow was one of many made by a half-elven craftsman whose name has been lost to history.  At one time there were several hundred in use, a favorite of scouts who patrolled the Anauroch desert, but many have been lost or destroyed.  Only a few are still known to exist, and they see little use due to the tremendous strength they require.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2<br />Damage:  +2<br />Proficiency Type: Longbow<br />Weight: 8<br />Requires: 18 Strength<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief<br /> Bard|
| *BOW10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW10.png "Heartseeker +3") | **Heartseeker +3**<br /><br />Heartseeker +3<br />Legends say that craftsman Pinn O'Reffen fashioned this bow from the heart of a Treant, though how he came to possess such material is unknown.  He certainly did not anticipate the enchantment within, magic that makes the archer's aim almost infallible for a short period every day.  Pinn claimed his skill was responsible, but it is more likely that some aspect of the soul of the Treant is still within the wood.  This bow requires a strength of 18 to use.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: Once per day can increase bow's aim to an additional +7 to hit for nine seconds<br />THAC0:  +4<br />Damage: +2<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Longbow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 18 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief<br /> Bard|
| *BOW11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BOW11.png "Strong Arm +2") | **Strong Arm +2**<br /><br />Strong Arm +2<br />This massive bow was the property of the ranger Bearpaw, who reportedly received it from a strangely benevolent ogre.  The reason for the gift was never discussed, but he earned the respect of everyone he met, and likely befriended the creature while patrolling the Cloakwood Forest.  Bearpaw could draw back the bow without the slightest effort, but when he died it was bequeathed to his wife and sons, and not a one could draw the string even halfway.  They eventually sold it to a merchant heading South.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage:  +3 bonus<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Longbow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 19 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief<br /> Bard|

It probably once was a bow used by guards in the service of the god Amaunator.  These guards would use the enchanted bows to keep the priests of that long-dead faith safe.  Few of these bows still exist, so they are sought after by many archers looking to improve both their accuracy and their lethality.  This bow requires a strength of 18 to use.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage:  +1 bonus<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Long Bow<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 18 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage <br /> Thief<br /> Bard|
