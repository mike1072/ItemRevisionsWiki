| *SLNG04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SLNG04.png "Sling +2") | **Sling +2**<br /><br />Magical slings are the hallmark of stout halfling warriors.  Usually their mothers or a talented aunt will create this sling for the halfling lad or lass who is about to embark on their second great adventure.  The reason that the sling is given on the second adventure and not the first is that many halflings decide not to pursue the life of an adventurer after getting a taste of it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  +2 (missile damage)<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:|
| *SLNG05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SLNG05.png "Sling +3: 'Arla's Dragonbane'") | **Sling +3: 'Arla's Dragonbane'**<br /><br />Sling +3: 'Arla's Dragonbane'<br />None know better than Halflings the value of a well-placed stone when confronting a larger foe.  This particular weapon was the property of a young woman named Arla Surestep, one of the few small-folk that leave the hearth to seek adventure.  Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for more humorous than lethal effect.  It would seem that Halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to their history.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  +3 (missile damage)<br />THAC0:  +3<br />Weight: 0<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Sling<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 3 Strength|
