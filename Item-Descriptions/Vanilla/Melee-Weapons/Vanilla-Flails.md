| *BLUN14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN14.png "Flail of Ages +3") | **Flail of Ages +3**<br /><br />This flail has been in the care of Lord Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiated when compiled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: A chance each hit that target will be slowed (no saving throw)<br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 4, +1 Acid Damage, +1 Cold Damage, +1 Fire Damage<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Flail/Morningstar<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage <br /> Thief|
