| *DWHALB01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/DWHALB01.png "Drow Halberd +3") | **Drow Halberd +3**<br /><br />Drow Halberd +3<br />By far the oldest and most often used pole-arm, the halberd consists of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length.  The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke, and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design.  The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry.  A halberd can be best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.  <br />This item, like most drow equipment, is created using Adamantine, an alloy of adamantite that quickly turns to dust if removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +3<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 15<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

| *HALB02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB02.png "Halberd +1") | **Halberd +1**<br /><br />Like others of its type, this halberd consists of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff approximately six feet in length. It has also been bestowed with a small number of magical properties, however, thus making it more effective in combat. Its keen blade, for instance, will shear through your opponent's flesh to find the bone while its barbed tip will seek out gaps in their armor.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 + 1<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 14<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *HALB03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB03.png "Halberd +2") | **Halberd +2**<br /><br />Halberd +2:  'Suryris' Blade'<br />Suryris, a white minotaur who traveled the Orsraun mountains in Turmish, lived for nothing but the thrill of combat, and encouraged warriors to challenge him for his magical weapon: a powerful halberd.  Despite his aggressive nature, he was an honorable combatant and never slew opponents he could overpower.  Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat.  The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryis knew he likely would have been bested had it continued.  He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D10 + 2<br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *HALB04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB04.png "Dragon's Bane +3") | **Dragon's Bane +3**<br /><br />Halberd +3: Dragon's Bane<br />This was the weapon of Thorvin Dukal, one of seven self-proclaimed Dragonslayers who spent years railing against what they called "an insidious dragon infestation that threatened Faerun."  Thorvin had this weapon enchanted at great expense and used it on many occasions, though of dragons only a single white has fallen to it.  The Dragonslayers met their match in a cantankerous ancient red who slew the entire group in an epic battle.  This weapon did not end up in the beast's hoard however, as the creature returned to its lair to recuperate and when it emerged the field of combat was well scavenged.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +3, +6 vs. dragons<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *HALB05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB05.png "Dragon's Breath +4") | **Dragon's Breath +4**<br /><br />Halberd +4 Dragon's Breath<br />Trying to profit from the strength of greater beings, many years ago the mage Ullion founded a dragon-worshipping cult under the moniker "Son of Drago."  Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold.  When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold.  Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor who sought to rule.  There was no real power to be had without the mage, so the entire organization soon collapsed on itself. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:     <br /> + 1 point of cold damage<br /> + 1 point of fire damage<br /> + 1 point of electrical damage<br /> + 1 point of acid damage<br /> + 1 point of poison damage<br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *HALB06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB06.png "Blackmist +4") | **Blackmist +4**<br /><br />Halberd +4: 'Blackmist'<br />This was the weapon of Dominique Harl, a sightless paladin who frequently traveled Faerun.  When attacked, Dominique would unleash the black mist that is this halberd's namesake, potentially blinding all within ten feet.  This often gave him the advantage, for he lived in darkness all his life, seeing only with the inner light of faith.  Dominique eventually fell, his body found in a dark forest, slain by a creature of the night even more at home in the shadows than he.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities:  <br />Blindness: <br /> Three times a day save vs. spells<br /> Area: 10 foot radius<br /><br />THAC0:  +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 + 4<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *HALB07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB07.png "Halberd +2") | **Halberd +2**<br /><br />Consisting of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff averaging six feet in length, the halberd is the oldest and most often used pole-arm.  It is best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.  Magic has been used to forge this particular weapon, gifting it with enhanced abilities to slaughter foes.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +2<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *HALB08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB08.png "Halberd +2, Duskblade") | **Halberd +2, Duskblade**<br /><br />Halberd +2 Duskblade<br />Though once a simple halberd, this weapon spent many hundreds of years in a tomb next to the soul phylactery of a powerful lich.  The creature was eventually erased from existence, purportedly by another of its kind, but such close proximity to that concentrated evil has imbued this blade with the very essence of night and the chill of darkness, energy that becomes deadly in combat.  It is a foul weapon, and a warrior should use it with caution. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +2,  +2 points of cold damage<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *HALB09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB09.png "Halberd +4: Wave") | **Halberd +4: Wave**<br /><br />Halberd +4: Wave<br />Forged in antiquity by a cult devoted to the goddess Umberlee, this weapon of vengeance was designed to aid the cult's champion in retrieving a holy artifact from the fire giants of the Storm Horn Mountains.  That was a lot of hope to place in one champion, and unfortunately the Wave had been lost ever since.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:     <br />15% chance of draining victim of water (+15 damage)<br />Slays Fire Elementals, Efreeti, Salamanders (no save)<br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10+4<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk <br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *HALB10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HALB10.png "Ravager +4") | **Ravager +4**<br /><br />Taking the blood-soaked shaft of this weapon in hand brings a sudden chill along your spine.  The origins of this gruesome halberd are unknown, though the very sight of it has been know to strike terror into the heart of an opponent.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Cast Cloak of Fear twice/day<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10+4<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Halberd<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 13 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk <br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
