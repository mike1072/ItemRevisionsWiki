| *SW1H07*<br />![Icon](../Images/SW1H07.png "Short Sword") | **Short Sword**<br /><br />The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence.

However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length.  The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D6<br />Damage type:  piercing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Short Sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric <br /> Mage |

In his loneliness he spent many hours alone in the hills overlooking Trademeet.  A nearby wizard, Galloma, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul.  The two fast became friends; master and apprentice.  Galloma died before Dramnek's tutorage could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world.  Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla.  There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma.  Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced Dramnek's weak physical body.

Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge.
