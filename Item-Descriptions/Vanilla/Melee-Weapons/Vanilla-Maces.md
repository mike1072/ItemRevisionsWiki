| *BLUN04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN04.png "Mace") | **Mace**<br /><br />The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with a stone or iron head mounted on the end. The head design varies; some being spiked, others flanged, and still others have pyramidal knobs.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage: 1D6 + 1<br />Damage type: crushing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN05.png "Mace +1") | **Mace +1**<br /><br />The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with an iron head mounted on the end.  In this case, the head is pyramidal and seems to glow with an inner blue light, as it sits atop a polished oak shaft.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1<br />Damage:  1D6 + 2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN11.png "Mace +2") | **Mace +2**<br /><br />Mace +2 : 'Krotan's Skullcrusher'<br />Even the hordes have their heroes, and while they are vilified in civilized company, their deeds are sometimes impressive nonetheless. Krotan was an exceptionally intelligent orc, as far as orcs go, who commanded an ever-shifting legion of ogres, orcs, hobgoblins, and other assorted beasties during the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241DR. It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed; though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orcs called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />THACO:  +2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN12.png "Mace of Disruption +1") | **Mace of Disruption +1**<br /><br />Mace of Disruption +1<br />This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead.  Any such creature hit by it not only feels the sting of weapon, but also has a chance of being simply blasted from existence.  There are legends that speak of a priest so holy a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: 2-12 +4 damage to Undead, plus they must make a saving throw vs. death (-4 penalty) or be utterly destroyed<br />THAC0:  +1<br />Damage:  1D6 + 2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN18.png "Skullcrusher +3") | **Skullcrusher +3**<br /><br />Mace +3: Skullcrusher<br />This mace is permanently bloodstained; a telltale trace of its many years spent bashing heads.  The weapon would have been the bane of humanoids throughout its history, but those that wielded it seem to have been purposely left out of historic record.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 4, +2 extra damage to humanoid creatures<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN19.png "Mauler's Arm +2") | **Mauler's Arm +2**<br /><br />Mace +2: Mauler's Arm<br />Jurrg the Mauler was proud chieftain of a northern tribe, but feared he would be the last of his family to lead.  His son Kullen was sickly, and clearly couldn't meet the traditional requirements of strength for a chieftain.  Jurrg knew that wise leadership took more than brawn, however, so he bargained to enchant this mace such that it would cover Kullen's weakness.  Who Jurrg made the deal with is unknown, but the cost was apparently high.  Kullen came to rule soon after.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Ability:  Increases wielder's strength to 18<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN20.png "Ardulia's Fall +1") | **Ardulia's Fall +1**<br /><br />Mace +1: Ardulia's Fall<br />Ardulia the Agile was a man whose speed and skill at knife play made him exceptionally lethal in battle, and he repeatedly proved it by leading raids on settlements along the Sword Coast.  He would often challenge the village leader for possession of the town, and with his speed, the duels were always quickly decided in his favor.  Ardulia met his match one spring morn however, when he battled the priest Itgan, who wielded this mace.  Ardulia seemed to stagger under each blow, slowing his pace to recoup and regain his breath.  Without his speed, Ardulia was lost, and fell to the measured attacks of Itgan.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Ability: A creature hit by this mace must make a saving throw vs. spells at +3 or be slowed for 12 seconds<br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN21.png "Mace +2") | **Mace +2**<br /><br />The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with an iron head mounted on the end.  The shaft of this magical mace seems to guide the wielder, becoming an extension of his hand.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN25*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN25.png "Mace of Disruption +2") | **Mace of Disruption +2**<br /><br />Mace of Disruption +2<br />This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead.  Any such creature hit by it not only feels the sting of weapon, but also has a chance of being simply blasted from existence.  There are legends that speak of a priest so holy a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians.<br />Now that the mace has been coated with illithium, it is even more potent, conferring to its user immunity to the life-draining powers of the more powerful undead.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: <br />2-12 +4 damage to Undead, plus they must make a saving throw vs. death (-4 penalty) or be utterly destroyed<br />Immunity to Level Drain<br />THAC0:  +2<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN28*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN28.png "Storm Star +3") | **Storm Star +3**<br /><br />This magical weapon is of ancient design, thought to have been devised in Netheril.  It crackles with spectacular arcs of lightning when wielded.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 4, +1D6 electrical damage<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 6<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *BLUN29*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/BLUN29.png "Storm Star +5") | **Storm Star +5**<br /><br />Infused with the other worldly Starfall Ore, the powers of this already formidable weapon are greatly enhanced.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br />   +20% to electrical resistance<br />Combat Abilities:<br />   5% chance of casting chain lightning on target with each successful attack<br /><br />THAC0:  +5 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 6, +1D6 electrical damage<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

| *HLOLTH*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/HLOLTH.png "Handmaiden's Mace") | **Handmaiden's Mace**<br /><br />This mace has been crafted finely by the drow, and specially treated to survive the glare of the sun.  It is made for surface raids by the subterranean race... and its black metal glistens with a dark poison that seems to be generated from within and causes incredible damage upon a successful impact.<br />The mace seems almost alive and warm to the touch, and slithers away from those whom it does not like... namely drow or those who are similar enough to not make a difference.  In the hands of anyone else, the mace becomes mere dead weight.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Ability: A creature hit by this mace must make a saving throw vs. poison or suffer 2 points of damage each round for 10 rounds.<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Mace<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Any who are not either Elf or Half-Elf Evil Clerics|
