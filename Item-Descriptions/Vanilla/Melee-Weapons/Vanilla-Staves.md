| *NPSTAF*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/NPSTAF.png "Staff of the High Forest") | **Staff of the High Forest**<br /><br />Staff of the High Forest<br /><br />This staff was the culmination of a cycle of seasons in which Cernd meditated on his role within nature.  His perch for this personal journey was next to a sapling, a young oak that was a particular interest of study; it seemed odd, and yet somehow wonderfully ordered.  At the coming of spring Cernd examined it one last time, and it came loose in his hands, a living staff, granted as boon from nature herself.  It has grown to fit his grip, and few others may wield it.   <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities: Regenerate 1 hit point every 12 seconds<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Type:  2-handed<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Cernd|
| *STAF01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF01.png "Quarterstaff") | **Quarterstaff**<br /><br />The simplest and humblest of staff weapons, the quarterstaff is a length of wood ranging six to nine feet in length.  High-quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends.  The quarterstaff must be wielded with both hands.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D6<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF02.png "Quarterstaff +1") | **Quarterstaff +1**<br /><br />The simplest and humblest of staff weapons, the quarterstaff is a length of wood ranging six to nine feet in length.  High-quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends.  This one is particularly special as it has been imbued with magical properties.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D6 + 1<br />THAC0:  +1<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF03.png "Quarterstaff") | **Quarterstaff**<br /><br />The simplest and humblest of staff weapons, the quarterstaff is a length of wood ranging six to nine feet in length.  High-quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends.  The quarterstaff must be wielded with both hands.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D6<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF05.png "Staff of Striking") | **Staff of Striking**<br /><br />Staffs of Striking are made by the Gold Elves of Drelagara on Evermeet. The staffs have a life of their own and jump to attack in their bearer's hands. The elven craftsmen rarely sell them to other races but these powerful melee weapons do surface occasionally in Faerun.  However, each attack made with the staff uses a charge, hence causing it to consume itself when no charges remain.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D6 + 9<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type: Two-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF06.png "Staff Mace") | **Staff Mace**<br /><br />This weapon appears to be a normal large walking staff, but it has a faint aura of alteration magic.  Uttering the command word causes the staff to assume the attributes of a mace, allowing it to be wielded with one hand.  This was likely designed for priests or druids, though that does not preclude use by most others.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  2D4 + 2<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Damage type:  Crushing<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monks|
| *STAF07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF07.png "Staff Spear +2") | **Staff Spear +2**<br /><br />If examined, this quarterstaff has an aura of alteration, and a long sharp spearhead extends from its upper end on command.  Likely made by a wizard or priest hoping to increase their melee abilities, it can be used by anyone capable of handling a staff.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D8 + 3<br />Damage type:  Piercing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF08.png "Martial Staff +3") | **Martial Staff +3**<br /><br />Martial Staff +3<br />This humble staff radiates powerful magic, and was likely the simple-seeming weapon of a traveling mage or cleric.  It would certainly prove more than ample for dealing with most threats encountered on the road.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +3<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF09.png "Staff of Command") | **Staff of Command**<br /><br />Staff of Command<br />The staff allows the user to dominate another creature, each use draining one charge.  This item is of the kind used by nefarious people seeking to sway others to follow their ways. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Abilities (one charge): Domination<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable by:<br /> Monk|
| *STAF10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF10.png "Staff of Curing") | **Staff of Curing**<br /><br />Staff of Curing<br />Torm is said to manifest these items during times of great trouble, granting them to priests who care for the wounded, diseased, and poisoned.  It is not to be taken for granted however, as the enchantment, though useful, is fleeting.  It must be used with all due care.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Abilities (one charge): <br /> Cure: 3 - 18 +3 hit points, Disease and Poison<br /><br />AC: +2 bonus<br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +1<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Thief<br /> Fighter<br /> Mage|
| *STAF11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF11.png "Staff of the Magi") | **Staff of the Magi**<br /><br />Staff of the Magi<br />This type of staff is thoroughly linked of the image of the spellcasting profession, rare though it is.  It is among the most powerful tools that a wizard can possess, the culmination of complex enchantment and endless study.  This particular example is good in melee, grants Invisibility, and offers protection from Charms and Evil.  It can also cast a Spell Trap, launch a Fireball-Lighting Bolt combination, and Dispel Magic. The quintessential mage item.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: +2 bonus<br />Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Invisibility<br /> Immunity to Charm<br /> Protection From Evil<br /><br />  Fireball-Lightning<br />   Damage: combined lightning and fireball damage<br />   Range: 150 feet<br />   Use: Three times a day<br /><br />Abilities: Trap Spell<br />   Duration: 8 hours or until 30 spell levels have been trapped<br />   Use: Once a day<br /><br />Combat Ability (each hit): Dispel Magic  <br />THAC0: +1 bonus  (strikes as a +5 weapon)<br />Damage:  1D6 +1<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By<br /> Mages|
| *STAF12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF12.png "Staff of Power") | **Staff of Power**<br /><br />Staff of Power<br />A mage's staff is far more than just a gilded walking stick, most being enchanted to an impressive degree.  This one is no exception, and whoever the previous owner was, they were powerful indeed.  It enables a mage to better escape hostile magic and avoid physical blows, and can erect a Globe of Invulnerability (one charge).  Offensively it can be used in melee very well, and cast a Lightning Bolt (one charge). <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Saving Throws: +2 bonus<br />Armor Class: +2 bonus<br />Abilities (one charge): <br /><br />Globe of Invulnerability<br /> Duration: 1 round/level<br /> Range: User <br /> Area: 5-foot-radius sphere <br /> Grants immunity to 1st to 4th level spells.<br /><br />Lightning Bolt of Paralyzation<br /> Damage: 10d6<br /> Range: 140 yards<br /> Saving throw: for half damage<br />    Also stuns (no save) the target for 5 rounds <br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By<br /> Mages|
| *STAF13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF13.png "Staff of Thunder and Lightning") | **Staff of Thunder and Lightning**<br /><br />Staff of Thunder and Lightning +2<br />There are stories that tell of these staves sprouting in the growth around druid groves when the forest is threatened.  Fanciful tales, but truth or not, this staff is a powerful tool.  It draws energy from storms, and there is a chance that any blow may trigger a thunderclap that knocks enemies down.  It casts Lightning Bolt, and if circumstances warrant it, it can summon a lighting storm to blast enemies to dust.  Some abilities are limited by charges.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Abilities (one charge):<br />Lightning Bolt<br /> Damage: 10d6<br /> Range: 140 yards<br /> Saving throw: Spells for half damage<br /><br />Call Lightning<br /> Lightning strike hits the target<br /> Damage: 3d8 per strike<br /><br />Melee:<br />Thunderclap (10% chance on a successful strike)<br /> Range: Melee <br /> Saving Throw: Save vs. spells or be stunned for two rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By:<br /> Clerics<br /> Druids|
| *STAF14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF14.png "Staff of the Woodlands +4") | **Staff of the Woodlands +4**<br /><br />Staff of the Woodlands<br />Known only as the "Wild Man of the Wood", the man that carried this staff was a legendary figure near Trademeet until the day he died and returned to the soil.  Those who saw him remember his dark, bark-like skin, a feature that would fade if the staff were set aside.  He would harass irresponsible loggers and poachers, and old-timers tell of mercenaries chasing him with a dozen hunting dogs or more.  The animals seemed ready to rip the poor druid to pieces, but he quickly turned them on their former masters.  Rushing forward in hopes of ending his influence, the men-at-arms saw the final power of the staff, and as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />AC: +3 bonus<br />Equipped Abilities: Barkskin (AC 3)<br /><br />Use Abilities (cost 1 charge)<br />Summon Shambling Mound<br /><br />Enhanced Charm Animal<br /> Duration: 5 minutes<br /> Saving throw: save vs. spells with a -4 penalty<br /><br />THAC0: +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +4<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength<br />Usable By<br /> Druids|
| *STAF15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF15.png "Staff of Air +2") | **Staff of Air +2**<br /><br />Staff of Air<br />This staff seems to draw from eleven artistic traditions, though tied less to the forest than is usually customary.  It was apparently designed to control air elementals, being able to summon one as a servant to the wielder, and potentially destroying creatures of the same type in a single blow.  When necessary, it can also spawn a cloud of gas causing anyone within the area of effect to fall into a deep slumber.  Some effects are limited by charges.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: If an air elemental is hit it must save vs. spells or be destroyed<br />Abilities: (cost 1 charge)<br />Summon an 8hd Air Elemental<br /> Duration: 1 hour<br /><br />Sleep Cloud<br /> Range: 40 feet<br /> Duration: 3 rounds<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF16.png "Staff of Earth +2") | **Staff of Earth +2**<br /><br />Staff of Earth<br />Linked to the Plane of Earth, this staff may have been fashioned by an ancient druidic sect.  It can summon an Earth Elemental, though it also has the potential to slay such creatures in a single blow, possibly hinting at how difficult it is to control them.  It can also free a person from the earth by casting Stone to Flesh.  Some abilities are limited by charges.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: If an earth elemental is hit it must save vs. spells or be destroyed<br />Abilities: (one charge)<br /> Summon an 8 hit dice Earth Elemental<br />  Duration: 1 hour<br />Stone to Flesh<br />  Revert effects of a petrification attack<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF17.png "Staff of Fire +2") | **Staff of Fire +2**<br /><br />Staff of Fire<br />This staff bears an ancient rune that may link it to the wizards of faraway Halruaa, but it is impossible to be certain.  Drawing from the Plane of Fire, it can erupt in a Fire Shield that damages attackers, it can summon a Fire Elemental under the control of the wielder, and it can potentially draw all the energy from any fire elemental that it hits, destroying them instantly.  Some abilities are limited with charges however.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: If a fire elemental is hit it must save vs. spells or be destroyed<br />Abilities: (one charge)<br />Summon an 8 hit dice Fire Elemental<br /> Duration: 1 hour<br />Fire Shield (Red)<br /> A protective shield that surrounds the wielder of the staff as per the 4th level wizard spell Fire Shield (Red).<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 +2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Quarterstaff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF18.png "Quarter Staff +2") | **Quarter Staff +2**<br /><br />Quarter Staff +2<br />The simplest of staff weapons is the quarterstaff, a length of wood six to nine feet in length.  High-quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends.  Powerful enchantments during the making of this staff have improved its accuracy and the damage it can cause, but they bear no signature.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF19.png "Cleric's Staff +3") | **Cleric's Staff +3**<br /><br />Cleric's Staff +3<br />This simple staff radiates a powerful enchantment, though its plain design suggests a simple origin.  It reflects the quiet strength that faith brings, and was likely the modest weapon of a priest or cleric.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +3<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF20.png "Staff of Rynn +4") | **Staff of Rynn +4**<br /><br />Quarter Staff +4, Staff of Rynn<br />There was a time when magic was distrusted even more so than now, and the burning of "heretics" was woefully common.  Delmarey, a witch from the swamplands near Myth Rynn, faced just such a fate when she was blamed for an unseasonable drought.  Taken by surprise and sentenced by a mob, she was put to the torch in the Village Square.  With her dying breath she uttered a foul curse, fueling the fire to an unstoppable magnitude.  By dawn, the entire village was reduced to black coal, save the burnt remnant of the pole Delmary had been bound to.  This staff has been imbued with some remnants of Delmarey's power, making it a highly enchanted weapon.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 4<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF21.png "Staff of the Ram +4") | **Staff of the Ram +4**<br /><br />Likely created by the same unknown Archmage who is responsible for the Ring of the Ram, this Staff of Striking does not use charges and will never become useless.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:  <br />  10 % Chance opponent is knocked back and stunned.<br /><br />Large creatures such as a dragons or giants will not be knocked back or stunned.<br /><br />THAC0:  +4 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 10<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type: Two-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF22.png "Staff of the Ram +6") | **Staff of the Ram +6**<br /><br />Roranach's Horn augments the Staff of the Ram's already noteworthy abilities, creating a weapon few opponents are able to stand against.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br />    15% Chance opponent is knocked back and stunned.<br /><br />Large creatures such as a dragons or giants will not be knocked back or stunned.<br />  <br />THAC0:  +6 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 12 crushing, +1D4 piercing<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type: Two-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF23.png "Serpent Shaft") | **Serpent Shaft**<br /><br />Adorned with serpentine designs, this powerful quarter staff has a chance to release a lethal toxin against its opponents with every blow.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br />  50% chance of poisoning opponents with every successful attack.  The poison lasts for 1 round, and does 2 hp of damage/second unless the target makes a save vs death.<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 2<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
| *STAF24*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/STAF24.png "Quarter Staff +3") | **Quarter Staff +3**<br /><br />Quarter Staff +3<br />The simplest of staff weapons is the quarterstaff, a length of wood six to nine feet in length.  High-quality quarterstaves are made of stout oak and are shod with metal at both ends.  Powerful enchantments during the making of this staff have improved its accuracy and the damage it can cause, but they bear no signature.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Requires: 5 Strength|
