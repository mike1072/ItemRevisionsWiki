| *NPSW02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/NPSW02.png "Yoshimo's Katana +1") | **Yoshimo's Katana +1**<br /><br />Yoshimo's Katana +1<br />This blade, although only lightly enchanted, has achieved a semblance of awareness, enough so that it allows only the thief known as Yoshimo to wield it.  Any other than he cannot use this flawless katana in battle.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +1<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Yoshimo|
| *NPSW04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/NPSW04.png "Corthala Family Blade") | **Corthala Family Blade**<br /><br />Corthala Family Blade<br />This fine katana radiates magical energy when wielded by Valygar.  The blade was designed to respond only to those with the blood of the family Corthala flowing through their veins.  This +2 blade causes additional bleeding damage when it strikes an opponent.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Abilities: 2 points of additional bleeding damage on target every round for 2 rounds<br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />AC: +2 bonus against slashing weapons<br />Damage:  1D10 +2<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Valygar|
| *SW1H43*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H43.png "Katana") | **Katana**<br /><br />Katana<br />The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process, that is more art form than anything else.  This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture.  To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath.  For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or  the gaijin has murdered a samurai.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D10<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  6<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H44*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H44.png "Katana +1") | **Katana +1**<br /><br />Katana +1<br />To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.  The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle.  Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D10 +1<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  5<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H45*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H45.png "Malakar +2") | **Malakar +2**<br /><br />Katana +2: Malakar<br />This sleek katana radiates magical energy when carried.  The Malakar, or 'Dueling Steel', was used by a less-than-honorable samurai during duels against other samurai.  As if of its own volition it will swoop down and deflect the slashing attacks of other weapons.  It is perfect for the warrior concerned about defense as well as offense.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />AC: +2 bonus against slashing weapons<br />Damage:  1D10 +2<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  4<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Katana<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
