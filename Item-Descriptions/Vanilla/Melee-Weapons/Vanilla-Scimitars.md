This item, like most drow equipment, is created using Adamantine, an alloy of adamantite that quickly turns to dust if removed from the Underdark.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D8 +4<br />THAC0: +3<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H15.png "Scimitar +3, Frostbrand") | **Scimitar +3, Frostbrand**<br /><br />This is the magical scimitar +3, Frostbrand.  It is one of Drizzt's personal weapons.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D8 + 3<br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage type:  Slashing<br />Weight:  4<br />Proficiency type:  Scimitar<br />Speed Factor:  2<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Mage<br /> Cleric|
| *SW1H16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H16.png "Scimitar +5, Defender") | **Scimitar +5, Defender**<br /><br />This is the magical scimitar +5 Defender that bears the name "Twinkle."  It is one of the personal weapons of Drizzt.  Due to its magical nature, only those pure of heart can use it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D8 + 3<br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Special:  +2  Armor Class bonus<br />Damage type:  Slashing<br />Weight:  4<br />Proficiency type:  Scimitar<br />Speed Factor:  2<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Evil or Neutral Alignment<br /> Mage<br /> Cleric|
| *SW1H20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H20.png "Scimitar") | **Scimitar**<br /><br />The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun.  Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence.  The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D8<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H22.png "Scimitar +1") | **Scimitar +1**<br /><br />The scimitar, or "shamshir" as it was originally called, has a single-edged blade with a significant curve, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  It is perhaps slower than other weapons of the same type, though it compensates by the amount of damage it is capable of.  This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to complement the skill of the wielder.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage:  1D8 +1<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H23.png "Scimitar +2, Rashad's Talon") | **Scimitar +2, Rashad's Talon**<br /><br />Scimitar +2: 'Rashad's Talon'<br />Named for Prince Rashad, former ruler of a minor principality to the East, this blade and many of the Prince's possessions were taken by disgruntled palace guards after his death. The role of the guards in the unfortunate affair was never determined, but rumor has it that all died within a year, slain by this very weapon.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D8 +2<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 3<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H30*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H30.png "Belm +2") | **Belm +2**<br /><br />Scimitar of Speed +2: Belm<br />This enchanted scimitar bears the mark of Taka Kobe, an honored swordsmith of Kara-Tur, though how it came to be here is unknown.  Perfectly balanced, it affords quick recovery in combat and even allows the wielder time for an additional attack.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: sets attacks to +1 per round<br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  1D8 +2<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 0<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H50*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H50.png "Shazzellim +1") | **Shazzellim +1**<br /><br />Scimitar +1, Shazzellim<br />This scimitar is of rather poor quality but beneath its surface lies great power and evil.  Created for the sole purpose of slaying Harpers, Shazzellim is more than capable of that task.  With one strike of the blade a bard must make a saving throw vs. spells or die.  Crafted by a Red Wizard of Thay, the sword also has the ability to vocalize, which is why it was often given to fighter-mages in the service of the Wizards.  Needless to say, possession of this sword would not be looked upon very highly by Harpers.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities:<br /> Vocalize<br /><br />Combat Abilities:<br /> Any bard hit must make saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty or die<br /><br />Damage:  1D8 +1<br />THAC0: +1<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  3<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H52*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H52.png "Scimitar +3") | **Scimitar +3**<br /><br />Scimitar +3: 'Water's Edge'<br />The blade of this weapon seems to shimmer, revealing a fluid, razor edge. Truly there was great skill involved in its construction, as well as a blessing or two from some well-meaning eye above, even though the hilt is comparatively almost clumsily adorned. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  1D8 +3<br />THAC0: +3<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 2<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H53*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H53.png "Sword of Flame +1") | **Sword of Flame +1**<br /><br />This blade burns with a magical fire, and a charring blast is released whenever a hit is scored. "Meta Infernum" is etched on the hilt, though it appears somewhat faded and may not be original to the sword.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0: +1 bonus<br />Damage: 1D8 + 1, +1 fire damage<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 4<br />Speed Factor: 4<br />Proficiency Type: Long Sword<br />Type: 1-handed<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H56*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H56.png "Scimitar") | **Scimitar**<br /><br />The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun.  Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence.

| *SW1H68*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H68.png "Spectral Brand +4") | **Spectral Brand +4**<br /><br />Legend has it that the the souls of those who fall beneath this dark blade are forever enslaved, and can be summoned to fight invisibly at the side of the very one who defeated them.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities:<br /><br />Summon spectral blade once/day.  This dancing sword fights on behalf of the one who wields Spectral Brand for 4 rounds, attacking once per round and doing 1D8+3 damage with each hit.<br />   <br />Damage:  1D8 +4, +1D4 cold damage<br />THAC0: +4<br />Damage type: slashing<br />Weight: 2<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Scimitar/Wakizashi/Ninja-To<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *SW1H69*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H69.png "Spectral Brand +5") | **Spectral Brand +5**<br /><br />Drawing on the necromancy of the Skull of the Lich, Spectral Brand is now an instrument of unholy death that should never have been unleashed upon the Realms.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities:<br />   Negative Plane Protection while equipped.<br />   Summon spectral blade once/day.
