| *SW1H01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H01.png "Bastard Sword") | **Bastard Sword**<br /><br />Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. The bastard sword has a double-edged blade and a long grip, which can accommodate both hands if preferred.  The overall length of the bastard sword ranges between four feet and four feet ten inches.   <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  2D4 <br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 10<br />Speed Factor: 8<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW1H02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H02.png "Bastard Sword +1") | **Bastard Sword +1**<br /><br />Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. This is a magical bastard sword.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage:  2D4 + 1<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  9<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW1H03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H03.png "Bastard Sword +1, +3 vs. Shapeshifters") | **Bastard Sword +1, +3 vs. Shapeshifters**<br /><br />Bastard sword +1, +3 vs. Shapeshifters:  'Kondar'<br />At first glance, this sword appears much like any other.  In the presence of any shapeshifting creature however, the blade becomes warm as its power stirs.  Its namesake was the original owner of the weapon, and his tale, though mostly long forgotten, was wrought with treachery and deceit.  Rumors persist that he paid a fearsome price for this blade, but with it he revealed the true identities of those that sought to betray him.  Their names and crimes however, are long since lost to history.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +1 bonus, +3 vs. Shapeshifters<br />Damage:  2D4 +1, +3 vs. Shapeshifters<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 8<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW1H18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H18.png "Sword of Balduran") | **Sword of Balduran**<br /><br />This ornate, but poorly balanced, bastard sword was found within the wreck of Balduran's ship.  Gold weapons are not known to be useful in combat, but legends say that only weapons forged of gold can harm such dread creatures as the Loup Garou.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Damage:  2D4 (+4 vs. Lycanthropes)<br />THACO:  +4 vs. Lycanthropes<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 12<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW1H34*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H34.png "Albruin +1") | **Albruin +1**<br /><br />Bastard Sword +1: Albruin<br />Basalin was a large man, rumored, far from his hearing, to be a were-bear.  He long wielded the sword Albruin in the protection of his village, slaying giant spiders that plagued the area.  The sword protected him from their poison and also allowed him to see invisible Red Wizards who controlled some of the more fantastic variants. The reason for their enmity is unknown.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities: <br /> Detect Invisibility once per day<br /> Protection from poison while wielded<br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage:  2D4 + 3<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  8<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW1H37*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H37.png "Taragarth +1") | **Taragarth +1**<br /><br />Taragarth the Bloodbrand, Bastard Sword +1<br />Dungeon-delving Lehorgan was lucky indeed to discover this Halruaan blade in the ruins of the ancient sorcerer Kullon's haunt, for it would save his life that very day.  The ghost of Kullon himself attacked the intruder, but the flames that followed only singed, absorbed into the glowing Bloodbrand.  Concealing himself, Lehorgan watched in amazement as the ancient sorcerer tried to divine his location and again the sword protected him.  Surviving this brush with death, the young man used this second chance and the gold from selling the blade to, as he put it, "get the hell out of adventuring." <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Equipped Abilities: <br /> 50% fire resistance<br /> Non-detection<br />Damage:  2D4 + 1<br />THAC0:  +1 bonus<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 7<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

Skilled in "persuasion", he would use this sword to perform the "Death Of A Thousand Cuts", an ancient ritual from his homeland involving a lengthy series of small, painful incisions.  The properties of the blade prevent blood from clotting, and the victim slowly bleeds to death.  The sword was stolen, and its whereabouts have been a mystery until now.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: 2 extra hit points damage every round, until 10 hit points of damage done<br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  2D4 + 2<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 7<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SW1H39*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SW1H39.png "Blade of Searing +3") | **Blade of Searing +3**<br /><br />Blade of Searing, Bastard Sword +3<br />The benefits inherent in this sword are plain to see; it is exceptionally accurate, and a lick of flame follows every blow, searing the target in addition to the normal damage received.  It is an efficient troll-killer, though it has not yet been heralded as such in song or legend.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: 1 extra point of fire damage<br />THAC0:  +3 bonus<br />Damage:  2D4 + 3<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight: 5<br />Speed Factor: 5<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

It is faster, more accurate, and hits for far more damage than the standard of its type.   <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />THAC0:  +2 bonus<br />Damage:  2D4 + 2<br />Damage type:  slashing<br />Weight:  7<br />Speed Factor: 6<br />Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword<br />Type:  1-handed<br />Requires: 11 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
