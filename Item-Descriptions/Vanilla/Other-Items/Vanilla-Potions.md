This does not reduce spellcasting time however.  The duration of the effect is 5 turns.|
| *POTN15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/POTN15.png "Red Potion") | **Red Potion**<br /><br />Close examination reveals this liquid to be very peculiar in nature. It could be a sorcerer's dream, but that would depend entirely on whom you asked.  After ingesting the mixture, the drinker becomes the weakest, most unwise, yet incredibly intelligent person to have ever lived, with an innate 50% magic resistance as well.  The effects remain for an entire 24 hours, so think carefully before unplugging the cork.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Intelligence:  set to 25<br />Wisdom:  set to 3<br />Strength:  set to 3<br />Special:  +50% resistance to all magical damage<br />Duration:  24 hours|

| *POTN18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/POTN18.png "Potion of Absorption") | **Potion of Absorption**<br /><br />This potion, as would be expected, will absorb external attacks once it has been consumed.

| *POTN21*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/POTN21.png "Potion of Clarity") | **Potion of Clarity**<br /><br />This potion will maintain clarity and order from encroaching chaos and insanity.  After drinking this potion, the imbiber feels an overwhelming feeling of calm and purpose, such that he will be unaffected by threatening influences such as feeblemind, confusion and charm.  This feeling will last for the duration of the enchantment or until dispelled.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special:  Prevents feeblemind, confusion, fear, and charm<br />Duration:  5 turns|
| *POTN22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/POTN22.png "Potion of Cold Resistance") | **Potion of Cold Resistance**<br /><br />This potion will confer to the imbiber a 50% resistance to all cold based attacks for the duration of the enchantment, in this case 10 turns.|
| *POTN23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/POTN23.png "Oil of Speed") | **Oil of Speed**<br /><br />This oddly murky oil would appear to increase the movement and combat capabilities of the imbiber by 100%.  Thus, a movement rate of 9, becomes 18, and a character normally able to attack once in a round attacks twice.  This does not reduce spellcasting time however.  The duration of the effect is 5 turns.|
