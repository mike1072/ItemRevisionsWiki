| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *WAND02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND02.png "Wand of Fear") | **Wand of Fear**<br /><br />A Wand of Fear strikes terror into the heart of any creature within its target area. This panic is not universal, however, as the stout of heart have been known to resist its magic. Like all wands, the Wand of Fear can only be used a limited number of times before it is destroyed.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special:  Cause enemies to run in fear unless they save vs. spells<br />Range:  100 ft<br />Area:  20 ft radius<br />Duration:  15 rounds<br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND03.png "Wand of Magic Missiles") | **Wand of Magic Missiles**<br /><br />When activated, the wand will eject a missile of magical energy that darts forth and unerringly strike its target. This includes enemy creatures in a melee. The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the spell ineffective.  Against a creature, the missile will inflict 1d4+1 points of damage.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special:  1 magic missile will strike target<br />Damage:  1D4 +1<br />Range: 100 ft<br />Area:  1 creature|
| *WAND04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND04.png "Wand of Paralyzation") | **Wand of Paralyzation**<br /><br />When used, this wand shoots forth a thin ray of bluish color to a maximum range of 60'.  When a creature is touched by the ray, it must roll a save vs. wands in order to avoid being stunned for 10 rounds.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Effect:  Stun target unless save vs. wands with -4 penalty<br />Range:  100 ft<br />Area:  1 creature<br />Duration:  10 rounds<br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Druid<br /> Cleric<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND05.png "Wand of Fire") | **Wand of Fire**<br /><br />The wand will cough forth a huge, burning ball of fire that streaks out to the desired range (to a maximum of 120') and bursts in a fiery, violent blast, just like the fireball spell.  The fireball inflicts 6d6 points of damage, but all 1s rolled are counted as 2s.  The victim(s) may make a save vs. wands in order to take only half damage.  The second ability of the wand is akin to the spell 'Agannazar's Scorcher' in that a column of flame will streak towards the victim inflicting 6D6 +6 damage, with a save vs. wands for half.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Ability  1:<br />Effect:  shoots out a Fireball<br />Damage:  6D6 (save vs. wands for half)<br />Range:  90 ft<br />Area 30 ft radius<br /><br />Ability  2:<br />Effect:  Agannazar's scorcher<br />Damage:  6D6 +6 (save vs. wands for half)<br />Range:  90 ft<br />Area:  1 creature<br /><br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND06.png "Wand of Frost") | **Wand of Frost**<br /><br />White crystalline motes spray forth from the wand in a column towards the victim, striking square in the chest with numbing force.  The temperature inside the column is deadly, and damage is 8d6 (treating all 1s rolled as 2s), with a save vs. wands for half.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Effect:  Column of Ice<br />Damage:  8D6 (save vs. wands for half)<br />Range:  100<br />Area:  1 creature<br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND07.png "Wand of Lightning") | **Wand of Lightning**<br /><br />The possessor of the wand can discharge six bolts of lightning.  As it passes through a creature, each bolt does 3d6 points of damage, with a save vs. wand for half damage.  The bolts will continue through the target and proceed  to 'rebound' until expended.  The wand may target up to six different enemies.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Effect:  Lightning bolt<br />Damage:  3D6 (save vs. wands for half)<br />Range:  100ft<br />Area:  Path of bolt<br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND08.png "Wand of Sleep") | **Wand of Sleep**<br /><br />This wand will emit a gold beam of energy at its targets up to a maximum range of 60', affecting a 40' cube.  If the target creatures fail their save vs. wands, they will fall into a deep, comatose sleep for 5 turns.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Effect:  Sleep unless victim saves vs. wands<br />Range:  90 ft<br />Area: 20 ft radius<br />Duration:  2 turns<br />Not usable by:|
| *WAND09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND09.png "Wand of Polymorphing") | **Wand of Polymorphing**<br /><br />This wand emits a thin, green beam that darts forth to a nearby target.  Any creature touched by this beam must make a save vs. wands or be polymorphed into a squirrel.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Effects:  Polymorph target into squirrel unless save vs. wands<br />Range:  5<br />Area:  1 creature<br />Duration:  permanent until dispelled<br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND10.png "Wand of Monster Summoning") | **Wand of Monster Summoning**<br /><br />This wand will summon 12 HD of  monsters, which appear within the area of effect and attack the user's enemies. They remain until the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain. These creatures vanish when slain. If no opponent exists to fight and the wizard can communicate with them, the summoned monsters can perform other services for the summoning wizard.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Effect:  Summon 12 HD of monsters<br />Range:  20 ft<br />Duration:  2 turns<br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND11.png "Wand of the Heavens") | **Wand of the Heavens**<br /><br />This wand will cause a pillar of flame to shoot out of the sky and strike the target of the invoker.  The flames will do 8D6 damage to the target unless the target makes a save vs. wands in which case it will take half.  The wand only has a certain amount of charges and will be destroyed when they are used.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Effect:  Flamestrike<br />Damage:  8D6 (save vs. wands for half)<br />Range:  120 ft<br />Area:  1 creature<br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Mage<br /> Bard<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND13.png "Wand of Cloudkill") | **Wand of Cloudkill**<br /><br />This wand emits a vapor bubble that travels towards the target, exploding into a deadly cloud of noxious gas that expands to fill an area roughly 20 feet in radius.  The cloud will instantly kill any creature with 4 HD or less with no saving throw.  Any creature within 5 to 6 HD must make a saving throw or be slain.  Creatures with greater than 6 HD simply take 1-10 damage for every round that they remain within the cloud.  The cloud will dissipate after approximately 1 turn.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Effects:  1-10 damage per round<br />  1-4 HD : Instant death, no save<br />  5-6 HD : save vs. death or instant death<br />Range:  60 ft.<br />Area:  20' radius<br />Duration:  1d4 turns<br />Not usable by:<br /> Fighter<br /> Cleric<br /> Druid<br /> Thief<br /> Paladin<br /> Ranger|
| *WAND14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND14.png "Web Sack") | **Web Sack**<br /><br />Wands are 1 1/4 feet long and slender.  They are made of ivory, bone, or wood and are usually tipped with something - metal, crystal, stone, etc.  They are fragile and tend to break easily.  Because of this, they are often kept in cases.  <br /><br />Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item).  When a wand runs out of charges, it is consumed and destroyed.|
| *WAND15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND15.png "Wand of Apprenti") | **Wand of Apprenti**<br /><br />This wand was created for you by your apprentices, and will randomly cast a variety of three spells, each from a separate elemental source.  It apparently has 50 charges.|
| *WAND18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND18.png "Wand of Spell Striking") | **Wand of Spell Striking**<br /><br />Ironically, these wands are both prized and hated by wizards.  They can tear down an enemy mage's defenses, but of course every mage knows the wands can also be turned against themselves.<br /><br />Cast Breach (uses 1 charge)<br />Cast Pierce Magic (uses 1 charge)<br /><br />Usable By:<br />Mage<br />Bard|
| *WAND19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND19.png "Wand of Cursing") | **Wand of Cursing**<br /><br />This wand instantly afflicts targets with blindness, deafness and renders them mute.  But perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this terrible device is that anyone can use it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />   Cast Blindness, Deafness and Silence on target, 1 charge (save vs. spell negates all effects)|

# Vanilla Rods
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *RODS01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RODS01.png "Rod of Absorption") | **Rod of Absorption**<br /><br />Rod of Absorption<br /><br />This rod acts as a magnet, drawing magic spells of any nature (priest or wizard) into itself. It then nullifies their effects. The magic absorbed must have been directed at the character possessing the rod.  To activate this absorption ability the user must use the wand, after which time they will be protected for four rounds or until the absorption disappears.<br />The rod will absorb nine levels of spells (and can defend against spells up to ninth level in power).  Each use of the rod expends one charge.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (one charge): Spell absorption for four rounds<br />Usable By:<br /> Cleric<br /> Mage|
| *RODS02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RODS02.png "Rod of Lordly Might") | **Rod of Lordly Might**<br /><br />Rod of Lordly Might<br />Also called The Wrath of Three Kings, though not associated with any named king in particular, this rod was likely made in 1090DR.  It saw use during The Battle of the Bones, but for which side is uncertain as it was found amongst the dead after a larger skirmish.  Three buttons unlock the rod's magic: the first transforms it into a fearsome enchanted Mace; the second, a hypnotic Flaming Blade; the third, a barbed Spear.  Only warriors can properly use its exotic mix of weaponry.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />This rod may transform into any of the following weapons when used.  Each weapon may also change back into the rod at will.<br /><br />Mace +2<br /> Special Abilities: Target must save vs. spells (+5 bonus) or be affected by fear for four rounds<br /> THAC0: +2 bonus<br /> Damage: +2<br /><br />Flaming Long Sword +1<br /> Special Abilities: Target must save vs. spells (+5 bonus) or be held for five rounds<br /> THAC0: +1 bonus<br /> Damage: +1<br /><br />Spear +3<br /> Special Abilities: Target must save vs. spells (+6 bonus) or take 2d4 points of magical damage<br /> THAC0: +3 bonus<br /> Damage: +3<br /><br />Usable By:<br /> Warriors|
| *RODS03*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RODS03.png "Rod of Resurrection") | **Rod of Resurrection**<br /><br />Rod of Resurrection<br />This rod enables anyone to resurrect the dead as if they were of high enough level to cast the resurrection spell and if they were a priest. No rest is required, as the rod bestows the life-giving effects.  Each use of the rod expends one charge.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities (one charge):  Resurrection|
| *RODS04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RODS04.png "Rod of Smiting") | **Rod of Smiting**<br /><br />Rod of Smiting<br />This long, thin rod can be wielded as a staff.  This rod has been designed to destroy golems.  Any golem struck by the rod must make a saving throw or be destroyed.  In the hands of any other than a cleric or mage the rod becomes unusable.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: If a golem is struck by the rod, the golem must make a saving throw vs. death or be destroyed.<br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D8 + 3, +10 vs. Golems<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Cleric|
| *RODS05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RODS05.png "Rod of Terror") | **Rod of Terror**<br /><br />Rod of Terror<br />When activated this rod may be used as a quarterstaff +3.  Any creature hit by the rod must make a saving throw vs. spells or flee in terror, fearing the wielder as if he or she were a flesh-eating demon from the Abyss.  There is a drawback to using this rod however.  Each time the rod is used there is a 20% chance that the wielder loses one point of Charisma permanently.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Combat Abilities: Target must make a saving throw vs. spells (+4 bonus) or flee in terror (lasts four rounds)<br />THAC0: +3 bonus<br />Damage:  1D6 + 3<br />Damage type:  crushing<br />Weight: 3<br />Speed Factor: 1<br />Proficiency Type: Staff<br />Type:  2-handed<br />Not Usable By:|
| *RODS06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/RODS06.png "Rod of Reversal") | **Rod of Reversal**<br /><br />This powerful item allows a warrior to quickly remove the magical defenses of an enemy mage.  It is particularly prized by Wizard Slayers.<br /><br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />   Cast Ruby Ray of Reversal (1 charge/use)<br /><br />Usable By:<br />Fighters<br />Rangers<br />Paladins|
| *WAND12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/WAND12.png "Wand of Wonder") | **Wand of Wonder**<br /><br />Wand of Wonder<br />Only those with a gambling streak dare use this wand in battle.  When triggered it is, at best, unpredictable and, at worst, suicidal.  The whimsical mage Malimak created it as a gift for a rival, though more as a prank than with hurtful intent.  The recipient's reaction is not known, though Malimak relocated shortly thereafter.  It should be used with caution, or not at all.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Special Abilities:  Random effects appear each time the wand is used.|
