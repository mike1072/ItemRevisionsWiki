| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *PLAT01*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT01.png "Plate Mail Armor") | **Plate Mail Armor**<br /><br />Plate mail is a combination of chain armor with metal plates covering the vital areas such as the chest, abdomen and groin.  Similar in construction to bronze plate mail, true plate mail comprises of chain and leather. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 50<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard <br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT02*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT02.png "Plate Mail +1") | **Plate Mail +1**<br /><br />Plate mail is a combination of chain armor with metal plates covering the vital areas such as the chest, abdomen and groin.  Similar in construction to bronze plate mail, true plate mail comprises of chain and leather.  In addition, this suit of plate mail is enchanted and gives additional bonuses to the wearer's armor class.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard <br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT06.png "Ankheg Plate Mail") | **Ankheg Plate Mail**<br /><br />This plate mail has been expertly crafted. Sheathed in the chitinous scales of the ankheg, it provides a greater degree of protection than traditional plate mail and is not susceptible to rust. As any world-weary adventurer will tell you, however, the best appreciated aspect of ankheg mail is its light weight and low encumbrance. Monsters come and go but fatigue is a constant enemy.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 25<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT08.png "Plate Mail +3") | **Plate Mail +3**<br /><br />Plate Mail +3 : 'The Practical Defense'<br />The traveling adventurer could ask for no better a suit of armor in all the land. Specially commissioned by Bolhur "Thunderaxe" at GREAT expense, this suit was his most prized, even if not his most ornate. Eminently practical, Bolhur demanded armor that would offer superior protection while hampering him in the least. By "hampering" he did not just mean in movement or weight, though this suit is just over one-third the weight of normal plate mail: his ideal suit should also be able to withstand the rigors of his wanderings with little maintenance. This is not to say that Bolhur "Thunderaxe" neglected his armors (to say as such would get your ears boxed) but the regime of spit and polish required for a "gentleman's" suit was beyond his caring. Save the tassels and gilding of Full Plate for kings and heads of state; a working dwarf cares more for utility than looks.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 0<br />Weight: 18<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT10.png "Plate Mail +1") | **Plate Mail +1**<br /><br />Plate mail is a combination of chain armor with metal plates covering the vital areas such as the chest, abdomen and groin.  Similar in construction to bronze plate mail, true plate mail comprises of chain and leather.  In addition, this suit of plate mail is enchanted and gives additional bonuses to the wearer's armor class.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 20<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard <br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT11*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT11.png "Delver's Plate +2") | **Delver's Plate +2**<br /><br />This armor has been worn by many a fine soldier, but among the best known, and for whom it was named, was Delver Kinlake.  He was a vagabond whose strong sword-arm and keen wits made him a respected general to the Lords of Waterdeep.  A gift from Lord Baeron, the armor served Delver well for thirty years, and after his death, it passed to his eldest son.  It has since made its way into the hands of a variety of adventurers.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 25<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard <br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT12*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT12.png "Doomplate +3") | **Doomplate +3**<br /><br />Named by Adarius Shin, the Doomplate is deserving of its foreboding title.  He had hoped to strike fear in his enemies, but Adarius set a grim precedent when he mysteriously died soon after donning the suit, just as every adventurer who has worn it since has done.  It might be said, however, that most adventurers die in their armor and are not known for their longevity.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 0<br />Weight: 27<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard <br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT13.png "Gorgon Plate +4") | **Gorgon Plate +4**<br /><br />Hunting Gorgons is a highly dangerous drow sport.  Often, after a successful hunt, the blood of the Gorgon is taken and used in the creation of a new suit of plate.  This special type of drow plate is actually able to withstand the light of the surface world.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: -1<br />Bonus:  15% resistance to fire and acid <br />Weight: 30<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard <br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT18.png "Red Dragon Scale") | **Red Dragon Scale**<br /><br />Dragon Scale armor is light of weight, strong, and resistant to fire.  Because of these properties it is much sought after, but finding, let alone slaying, a powerful ancient dragon is near impossible.  It is usually easier to search for an existing suit, such as this one.  One should be careful wearing it near dragons, however, particularly red ones.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Bonuses: +50% Fire Resistance<br />Armor Class: -1<br />Weight: 30<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *PLAT22*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/PLAT22.png "Shuruppak's Plate") | **Shuruppak's Plate**<br /><br />Shuruppak, the infamous right hand of the now dead god Gilgeam, earned the title of "Reaper" for his savage butchery of any who opposed him... an identity the bloodthirsty madman eagerly embraced.  Before Gilgeam's destruction, the god presented Shuruppak with an enchanted suit of armor, to better enable the Reaper to slaughter his foes.<br /><br />Shuruppak's plate is surprisingly light and grants the wearer an unnatural quickness and grace.  It is not known how Shuruppak lost this treasured item, but one could safely assume he is still looking for it...<br /> <br />STATISTICS:<br />   +1 to Dexterity<br />   +20% Fire Resistance<br /><br />Armor Class: -2<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

All that remains of the origin of the Hart are folktales and legends.  The most popular of these is that an impossible battle was once fought against an army of orcs surging through the Three Trees Pass.  Arngor of the Oak led the armies of men and elves and it is said that he dueled with the orc commander till the sun set and the land was bathed in a bloody mist.  Finally the orc fell but Arngor had sustained wounds too vast for any to save him.  His blood soaked through the armor he wore, infusing it with his courage and nobility.  Thus the Armor of the Hart became known to men.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: -2<br />Weight: 45<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
