Nay, from my hammer!"<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 5<br />Weight: 3<br />Requires: 12 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

His horse remained unscathed allowing for their escape, and his body was carried back to the nearest town, where he was resurrected from death. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: +1 bonus, +4 vs. Missile Weapons<br />Weight: 12<br />Requires: 15 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|

Upon hearing that a red dragon was ravaging the countryside, Pellan mounted his horse and rode off to do battle.  As it happened, Pellan and his armor digested readily enough, but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps.  Subsequently coughed up, it lay in a hoard for years until retrieved by Pellan's son, a warrior who knew when to sneak. <br />Superior craftsmanship is supplemented by a permanent lightness spell, which makes the shield very easy to wield.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class Bonus: 3<br />Special: +1 vs. Missile Weapons<br />Weight: 10<br />Requires: 10 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
| *SHLD23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/SHLD23.png "Fortress Shield +3") | **Fortress Shield +3**<br /><br />This shield, as tall as a man, is aptly named.
