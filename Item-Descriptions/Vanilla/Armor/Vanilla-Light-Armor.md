| *LEAT09*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT09.png "Karajah's Leather Armor") | **Karajah's Leather Armor**<br /><br />Leather Armor +3: Karajah's Life and Death<br />Karajah was Calimshan's champion of pit fighting for a full decade, and seemingly unbeatable.  His success, or so he claimed, was due to the mobility that his light armor afforded him.  He may well have been unaware of the suit's other qualities, but his peers ignored his claims of ignorance when enchantments were discovered.  The armor survived the subsequent beating, whereas Karajah did not.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 4<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not usable by:<br /> Mage|

| *LEAT14*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT14.png "The Night's Gift +5") | **The Night's Gift +5**<br /><br />Originally blessed by Shar, this armor has a long and interesting history.  Only the greatest of thieves have ever owned this heavily enchanted armor.  The essence of night has been woven into the dark set of armor so that it feels like normal armor but encloses the wearer in a mass of twisting shadows.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Bonuses: +20% to hide in shadows<br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 5<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|

# Vanilla Studded Leather Armor
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *LEAT04*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT04.png "Studded Leather Armor") | **Studded Leather Armor**<br /><br />Studded leather armor has little in common with normal leather armor.  Instead of a hardened shell, studded leather offers hundreds of metal rivets affixed to a supple backing.  The numerous studs form a flexible coat of metal that helps to turn aside slashing and cutting attacks, while the leather is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place.  <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 7<br />Weight: 25<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT05*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT05.png "Studded Leather Armor +1") | **Studded Leather Armor +1**<br /><br />Studded leather armor has little in common with normal leather armor.  Instead of a hardened shell, studded leather offers hundreds of metal rivets affixed to a supple backing.  The numerous studs form a flexible coat of metal that helps to turn aside slashing and cutting attacks, while the leather is little more than a means of securing the rivets in place.   <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 6<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT06*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT06.png "Missile Attraction +2") | **Missile Attraction +2**<br /><br />Cursed Studded Leather<br />This odd looking suit of studded leather cannot be removed once put on, except under intervention by a sorcerer.  While improving the protection against all melee weapons, this armor actually becomes a target for missile weapons, and hence so does its wearer.  The choice is simple, deadly arrows or deadly swords. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 5  (15 vs. missile weapons)<br />Weight: 8<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT07*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT07.png "Studded Leather Armor +2") | **Studded Leather Armor +2**<br /><br />This armor is the standard armor given out to griffon riders and other warriors who use mounted steeds.  It is lightweight but offers good protection, especially with the extra magical protections crafted upon it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 8<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br />Mage|
| *LEAT08*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT08.png "Shadow Armor") | **Shadow Armor**<br /><br />Shadow armor is studded leather armor created for use by the Shadowmasters of Amn.  The Shadowmasters are of the highest order within the Shadow Thief hierarchy.  It is +3 studded leather armor that melds into shadows.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 4<br />Special:  +15% Hide in Shadows<br />Weight: 8<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Only Usable By:<br />Thief (single, multi and dual class)|
| *LEAT15*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT15.png "Studded Leather Armor +2") | **Studded Leather Armor +2**<br /><br />This armor is the standard armor given out to griffon riders and other warriors who use mounted steeds.  It is lightweight but offers good protection, especially with the extra magical protections crafted upon it.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 5<br />Weight: 8<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br />Mage|
| *LEAT16*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT16.png "Orc Leather +3") | **Orc Leather +3**<br /><br />This ghastly armor was taken from an orc camp destroyed by barbarians.  Instead of standard metal rivets, like normal studded leather, this orc leather is instead laced with hundreds of fire hardened bones.  Finger bones, ribs, and skulls cover the armor, acting much like the traditional metal rivets.  Powerful orcish enchantments give the armor special resistance to missile attacks, but the repulsiveness of the armor reduces the wearers charisma.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Bonuses: +10% Resistance to missile attacks<br />Penalties: -1 to Charisma<br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 7<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT17*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT17.png "Armor of Deep Night +4") | **Armor of Deep Night +4**<br /><br />Enchanted ebony rivets adorn the black leather of this armor.  Umberlee the Sea Queen granted this armor to Dami Darn, a rogue who slew the conjurer Looxil.  The assassination pleased  Umberlee, for Looxil had betrayed her in years past. Dami Darn died years later, a knife to the back from her successor in the thieves' guild.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 7<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT18*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT18.png "Armor of the Viper +5") | **Armor of the Viper +5**<br /><br />This armor's namesake is a serpent only in manner, referring to the Drow assassin Raroh.  Poison was his trademark, and when he discovered this suit's susceptibility to venom, he gifted it to Avlorm, a promising novice assassin within his own guild.  When Avlorm's power eventually threatened his own, Raroh easily dispatched him, thanks to the weakness of the armor he still wore.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Penalties: -2 penalty to all saves vs. poison/paralyzation<br />Armor Class: 2<br />Weight: 6<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|

# Vanilla Hide Armor
| Item | Description |
| :-------: | :-------  |
| *LEAT10*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT10.png "Hide Armor") | **Hide Armor**<br /><br />Hide Armor is made from the thick skin of large animals (elephants, for example) or layers of thinner, more common leather.  It is considered too cumbersome for use in advanced human cultures, but is common among more barbaric humanoids.  It offers better protection than normal leather, but can be hard to maintain, often resulting in an offensive odor or shoddy appearance that prevents effective use.  Thieves can wear this armor, but it has a negative effect on their abilities.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Armor Class: 6<br />Move Silently: -20<br />Lock Picking: -10<br />Find/Remove Traps: -10<br />Pick Pockets: -10<br />Weight: 40<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT13*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT13.png "Skin of the Ghoul +4") | **Skin of the Ghoul +4**<br /><br />A clever thief, Damien Oneknife always tried to gain from the assets of his enemies, no matter the circumstances.  After an intense battle with several ghouls in which two of his companions perished, Damien decided to even the odds in future encounters.  He skinned one of the undead creatures and brought the hide to a halfling armorer talented in enchanting leather.  When the suit was finished it was magically protective against physical attacks and paralyzation.  Not very epic perhaps, but practical. <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Bonuses: +3 bonus to all saves vs. paralyzation/poison<br />Armor Class: 4<br />Weight: 4<br />Requires: 3 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT19*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT19.png "Shadow Dragon Scale") | **Shadow Dragon Scale**<br /><br />This suit of armor is formed from interlocking shadow dragon scales.  Elegant workmanship and practical considerations make this armor both beautiful and useful.  The shadow dragon scales grant the wearer extra protection from acid.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Bonuses: +50% Resistance to Acid<br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 10<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT20*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT20.png "Aeger's Hide +3") | **Aeger's Hide +3**<br /><br />This heavy and thick bear hide is all that remains of the fabled Aeger.  Several hundred years ago the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast.  The bear was invulnerable to fire, cold or acid.  Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong.  The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain.  Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves.  Out of one of the pieces this armor was created.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Bonuses: +15% resistance to fire, cold, and acid<br />                Immune to Confusion<br />Armor Class: 3<br />Weight: 35<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage|
| *LEAT23*<br />![Icon](Item-Descriptions/Vanilla/Images/LEAT23.png "Studded Leather of Thorns +6") | **Studded Leather of Thorns +6**<br /><br />Fashioned by the Hierophant Wassalia before she chose to forever dwell on the Elemental Plane of Fire, this suit of armor is not covered by typical metal studs but by heavy red thorns.      <br /><br />STATISTICS:<br />Thorn Damage - each successful hit on the wearer inflicts 1d4 points of fire damage to the attacker<br /><br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 5<br />Requires: 6 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Mage<br /> Monk|
