She had rewarded the ranger's loyalty with the promise that he would never die in battle, and he defied death for many years, holding orcish hordes back from his home forest.  A heart attack claimed him when his time was done, not an enemy's blade.<br /><br />STATISTICS:<br /><br />Bonuses:  +1 bonuses to all saving throws<br />Armor Class: 1<br />Weight: 15<br />Requires: 8 Strength<br />Not Usable By:<br /> Bard<br /> Druid<br /> Mage<br /> Thief|
